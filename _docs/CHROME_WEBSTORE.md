# Chrome Web Store Publishing Guide

This document contains the existing Chrome Web Store privacy-practices notes and
permission justifications. It predates the complete v4 provider and data-flow
inventory and must be reconciled with the final package before submission. Media
assets are available in `./chrome-webstore/`.

The staged v4 item summary, detailed description, screenshot sequence, and
pre-submission gates live in
[`CHROME_WEBSTORE_LISTING.md`](./CHROME_WEBSTORE_LISTING.md).

## Single Purpose Description

**What does your extension do?**

WalletChan is a self-custodial Ethereum and EVM browser wallet. It lets users
create or import accounts, connect them to web3 apps, review and sign requests,
view assets, send tokens, swap, and bridge on supported chains. WalletChan
injects a standard Web3 provider and also supports local keys, Ledger hardware
accounts, existing Safe multisigs, view-only accounts, and optional Bankr
remote-signing accounts.

## Permission Justifications

### 1. activeTab

**Justification:**

It enables our extension to:

1. Detect which dApp the user is currently visiting
2. Display the correct favicon and origin in transaction confirmation dialogs
3. Communicate with the content script to set the wallet address and chain ID for the active tab
4. Position the transaction confirmation popup relative to the current browser window

The extension only accesses the active tab when explicitly invoked by the user through clicking the extension icon or when a dApp initiates a transaction request.

---

### 1a. alarms

**Justification:**

WalletChan uses `chrome.alarms` for bounded background reliability work that
must survive Manifest V3 service-worker suspension:

1. Periodically refresh imported existing-Safe account and proposal state.
2. Reconcile pending or ambiguous Safe executions until their onchain result is
   known, then clear the reconciliation alarm.
3. Schedule a delayed retry of Privacy Pools ASP/compliance eligibility data
   when the wallet UI is closed.

The permission is not used for analytics, advertising, user profiling, or
unrelated background browsing.

---

### 1b. favicon

**Justification:**

WalletChan uses Chrome's internal favicon endpoint to show recognizable site
icons for decentralized websites opened through ENS/IPFS gateways in the
wallet's browsing, bookmark, and request-review interfaces. The implementation
only accepts explicitly validated HTTPS hosted-gateway URLs (`*.eth.limo`,
`*.eth.link`, `*.gwei.domains`, and `*.w3eth.io`) and local IPFS/IPNS subdomain
gateway URLs.

The permission is not used to read browsing history, inspect page content, or
enumerate arbitrary websites.

---

### 2. storage

**Justification:**

The storage permission is essential for the extension to function. It is used to store:

1. Encrypted Wallet Material: Imported private keys, seed phrases, and optional
   Bankr API credentials are encrypted before storage in `chrome.storage.local`.

2. Account Metadata: Public account addresses, account types, names, derivation
   metadata, Ledger paths, Safe associations, and view-only addresses are stored
   so the wallet can restore the user's account list.

3. Network Configuration: Custom RPC endpoints and network settings are stored in `chrome.storage.local`.

4. Pending Transactions: Transaction requests from dApps are stored persistently so they survive popup closes and browser restarts. This prevents data loss if the user accidentally closes the popup before confirming.

5. Transaction History: Completed transactions (up to 50 entries) are stored for user reference.

6. User Preferences: Settings like auto-lock timeout, side panel mode preference, and selected network are stored.

---

### 3. sidePanel

**Justification:**

The sidePanel permission enables the extension to open in Chrome's built-in side panel (Chrome 114+) as an alternative to the traditional popup. This provides a better user experience because:

1. Persistent View: Unlike popups that close when clicking outside, the side panel remains open while users interact with dApps, allowing them to review and confirm multiple transactions without repeatedly reopening the extension.

2. More Screen Space: The side panel provides more vertical space for displaying transaction details, signature requests, and transaction history.

3. Multi-Transaction Workflow: When interacting with complex dApps that require multiple transactions, users can keep the side panel open and confirm transactions sequentially without interruption.

On supported Chrome and Chromium installs, the extension enables side-panel mode
by default after onboarding. Users can switch to popup mode at any time.
Unsupported environments retain the popup path, and a failed side-panel open
falls back to a detached popup for the current request.

---

### 4. notifications

**Justification:**

The notifications permission is used to alert users about the status of their blockchain transactions after they close the extension popup or sidepanel. Specifically:

1. Transaction Confirmed: When a transaction is successfully confirmed on the blockchain, a notification is shown with the message "Your transaction on {chainName} was successful".

2. Transaction Failed: When a transaction fails, a notification is shown with the error message so users are aware of the failure even if they're not actively viewing the extension.

This is essential for user experience because blockchain transactions can take from a few seconds to several minutes to confirm. Users should not be required to keep the extension open while waiting for confirmation.

---

### 4b. offscreen

**Justification:**

WalletChan uses packaged offscreen documents for two Chrome-only operations that
must continue independently of the popup and Manifest V3 service-worker
lifecycle:

1. Ledger hardware wallets: After the user explicitly selects a Ledger
   through Chrome's WebHID chooser, an offscreen document maintains the device
   transport while addresses are derived or the user reviews and approves a
   transaction or message on the device. Ledger private keys never leave the
   hardware device.
2. Privacy Pools: A separate packaged offscreen worker performs the
   computationally intensive local proof generation required for user-requested
   shielding and unshielding operations.

Both documents use only code bundled with the extension. They do not capture
pages, inspect browsing content, execute remote code, run analytics, or display
advertising. They are closed after the requested operation or an idle timeout.

---

### 5. tabs

**Justification:**

The tabs permission is used for two specific purposes:

1. Onboarding Tab Management: When the extension is first installed, it opens an onboarding page in a new tab. When the user completes onboarding and opens the extension popup, the onboarding tab is automatically closed to avoid leaving unused tabs. This requires the ability to query for tabs with the extension's URL pattern and close them.

2. Tab-Specific Chain State: Each browser tab maintains its own selected blockchain network. When the user switches between tabs, the extension queries the active tab to update the network dropdown to reflect that tab's chain selection. This ensures the UI always shows the correct network for the current dApp.

The extension does not read tab content, URLs, or any sensitive information. It only uses the tabs API for the specific purposes listed above.

---

### 6. Host Permissions (https://_/_ and http://_/_)

**Justification:**

WalletChan is a Web3 wallet that must work on any website with dApp functionality. Specifically:

1. Content Script Injection: Bridges communication between dApps and the extension. Standard practice for all Web3 wallets.

2. Web3 Provider Injection: Provides `window.ethereum` and announces via EIP-6963 for wallet discovery.

3. RPC Proxy: Proxies blockchain calls through background worker to bypass strict Content Security Policies.

4. Transaction Interception: Intercepts `eth_sendTransaction` to show confirmation dialogs before submission.

Without broad host permissions, the wallet would be unusable on most dApps.

---

### 7. Remote Code

**Justification:**

The extension does NOT use remote code execution. All JavaScript code is bundled at build time and included in the extension package.

The extension does make network requests to:

1. Bankr API (`api.bankr.bot`): To submit transactions and poll for their completion status
2. Blockchain RPC endpoints: To read blockchain state (balances, contract data, etc.)
3. eth.sh API: To fetch address labels for display in the UI
4. Google Favicons API: To display website favicons in the transaction confirmation dialog

None of these requests involve downloading or executing code. They are purely data fetching operations using standard fetch/HTTP requests.

---

### 8. declarativeNetRequestWithHostAccess

**Justification:**

Used solely to power the ENS Browsing feature (the `*.eth` address-bar feature added in v3.9.0). Two rule types are registered:

1. HTTPS-upgrade exemption for `*.ipfs.localhost`: Chrome auto-rewrites http:// to https://, which breaks local IPFS / Kubo gateways running on 127.0.0.1. A static rule disables the upgrade only for that hostname.

2. ENS gateway interception: `*.eth.limo`, `*.eth.link`, and (in local-pin mode) `*.w3eth.io` requests are redirected through the extension's resolver so users land on the correct gateway — public eth.limo / w3eth.io, or a local Kubo node if configured. A per-tab session-scoped ALLOW rule lets the in-page banner's "Open on gateway" action bypass the redirect on one click.

The extension does NOT block ads, modify third-party headers, or read response bodies. All rules are scoped to ENS Browsing and are removed when the user disables it in Settings.

---

### 9. unlimitedStorage

**Justification:**

WalletChan needs `unlimitedStorage` because it is a crypto wallet that must reliably persist encrypted wallet vault metadata, pending transaction/signature requests, WalletConnect request routing, transaction result records, user-added accounts, custom networks, and transaction history. It also maintains optional public metadata caches for token details, logos, clear-signing descriptors, and ENS/avatar display so users can safely review transactions. Without `unlimitedStorage`, normal wallet activity across many tokens and dApps can exhaust Chrome's default extension storage quota and cause critical wallet writes to fail, including saving a pending transaction, returning a confirmation result to a dApp, or updating encrypted vault/account state. The permission is only used for this extension's own `chrome.storage.local` data. It is not used to read browsing history, page contents, or files, and non-critical caches are best-effort and pruned regularly.

## Privacy Policy URL

https://github.com/walletchan/walletchan/blob/master/PRIVACY_POLICY.md

---

## Content Scripts Justification

The extension uses content scripts (`inject.js`) that run on all web pages (`<all_urls>`) because:

1. Web3 wallets must be available on any website that implements dApp functionality
2. The script bridges communication between the page's Web3 provider and the extension
3. This is the standard architecture used by all major Web3 wallets (MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Rainbow, etc.)

The content script only:

- Listens for Web3-related messages from the page
- Forwards wallet requests to the background service worker
- Returns responses back to the page
- Does NOT read page content, DOM, or any user data

---

## Web Accessible Resources

The extension exposes `static/js/inpage.js` as a web accessible resource so it can be injected into page contexts. This script:

1. Creates the `window.ethereum` Web3 provider object
2. Announces the wallet via EIP-6963 for wallet discovery
3. Intercepts wallet method calls (like `eth_sendTransaction`)
4. Communicates with the content script via `postMessage`

This is required for dApps to detect and interact with the wallet.

---

## Additional Notes for Review

1. **Open Source**: The extension source code is available at the repository linked in the extension listing.

2. **No Monetization**: The extension does not contain ads, in-app purchases, or any form of monetization.

3. **Security**: Wallet secrets and optional service credentials are encrypted
   before local storage. Ledger keys remain on the device. Passwords are not stored
   as plaintext.

4. **EVM Chain Scope**: The extension includes a curated registry of Ethereum
   and EVM mainnets plus native testnets. Eligible local, Ledger, and view-only
   accounts may also add custom EVM networks; optional Bankr accounts use a
   smaller explicitly supported built-in subset.
