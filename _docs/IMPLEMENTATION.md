# WalletChan Transaction Handling Implementation

## Overview

WalletChan is a multi-account Ethereum/EVM browser wallet that supports six
account models:

1. **Private Key Accounts** - Standard wallets with local key storage for transaction signing
2. **Seed Phrase Accounts** - BIP39/BIP44 groups whose derived keys sign locally
3. **Ledger Accounts** - Hardware-backed accounts that sign on a connected Ledger in Chromium
4. **Impersonator Accounts** - View-only addresses that cannot sign; a
   per-RPC developer opt-in may submit their reviewed transactions to a fork
   node with `eth_sendTransaction`
5. **Safe Accounts** - Existing Safe multisig contract accounts whose proposals
   are approved or executed by linked eligible owner accounts
6. **Bankr API Accounts** - Optional remote-signing accounts that execute
   supported transactions through the Bankr API

This document describes the core architecture and transaction handling implementation.

### Account-type extension checklist

`chrome/accounts/accountTypePolicy.ts` owns general direct-signer classification.
Its `ACCOUNT_TYPE_CAPABILITIES` table uses `satisfies Record<AccountType, ...>`:
adding a type in `chrome/types.ts` fails typechecking until its capability row is
declared. `DirectSigningAccountType` and `DirectSigningAccount` derive from the
literal table, rather than maintaining another union of signer names.

`requests/pinnedRequest.ts:isRequestSigningAccount` and
`walletConnect/sessionPolicy.ts:isSigningAccount` are compatibility aliases of
the same `isDirectSigningAccount` guard. Pending-account resolution, shared
signature confirmation types, and `signatures/externalTypedData.ts` use this
classification. Thus declaring a future hardware EOA as a direct signer also
includes its stored address in external V3/V4 verifier protection. The request's
pinned signer remains protected independently. Safe and impersonator records
are not direct signers; imported-Safe owner signatures remain available.

When adding an account type (for example Trezor):

1. Add its `AccountType` and `Account` model and choose its core capability row.
   Reuse the shared guard/types; do not duplicate the general signer list.
2. Implement and review signer transport, device binding, session/master/agent
   authorization, persisted request shapes, method/chain support, and final
   signature/transaction release gates. Classification alone grants none of these.
3. Choose Safe owner/executor/fee-token capabilities in the separate exhaustive
   `safe/accountTypePolicy.ts` matrix and review other feature-specific limits.
4. Run account-capability, signature, pending-request, WalletConnect, and Safe
   tests for every signer type; verify self/other-EOA rejection and imported-Safe
   acceptance. Add hardware QA where applicable and rebuild the full extension.

`tests/accounts/accountTypePolicy.test.ts` compiles isolated copies of the real
account model and policy with a synthetic future type: a missing capability row
must fail, and its declared capability determines the derived signer type.

## Known ERC-20 calldata encoding protection

`lib/calldataValidation.ts` checks exact static argument length and zero upper
12 bytes of address slots for approve, transfer, transferFrom, increaseAllowance,
decreaseAllowance, and legacy increaseApproval/decreaseApproval. Injected and
WalletConnect single/batch validators apply this policy before request intake;
contract initcode and unknown selectors remain outside this selector policy.
The existing single/batch review guard also blocks malformed queued requests.
Canonical legacy allowance mutations participate in simulation approval-intent
analysis, with verified final allowance read through the existing projection.
Transaction bytes are never silently repaired. See
[LEGACY_APPROVAL_PADDING.md](./LEGACY_APPROVAL_PADDING.md) for reproduction and QA.

## Arbitrum delayed-inclusion recovery

The signed `sendL2Message` path validates the Bridge event sender against
Nitro's L1-to-L2 address alias (addition modulo 160 bits), including for EOAs.
`arbitrumForceInclusion/receiptValidation.ts` shares that check between initial
submission and recovery and preserves kind, data-hash, message-index, signed
prefix, and child-hash validation. The stored sender remains the exact emitted
alias required by the force-inclusion preimage.
Successful history entries with L1 gas already accounted for are skipped during
startup; successful entries missing gas only backfill that gas and never reopen
force-message validation or downgrade success. Each failed recovery is isolated
so other entries and bundles continue, with a local warning containing history
ID, transaction hashes, and the failed check. Startup catches scan-level failures.
No transaction bytes, credentials, or new storage keys are logged or introduced.

## Theme Engine

As of v3.2.0 the extension ships a token-driven theme engine. Current themes:
**Bauhaus** (light, geometric, primary colors, hard shadows), **Midnight**
(dark, neutral financial surfaces, blue action focus, quiet elevation). Users select a theme
from Settings → Appearance; the choice persists in
`chrome.storage.local` and does NOT sync across devices.

**Architecture:**

```
apps/extension/src/theme/
├── tokens.ts                # ThemeTokens interface — every theme satisfies this contract
├── createTheme.ts           # Orchestrator: tokens → Chakra extendTheme config
├── recipes/                 # Internal Chakra recipes: actions, fields, selection,
│                            #   content, feedback, and overlays
├── ThemeProvider.tsx        # React context + ChakraProvider wrapper, switches at runtime
├── useThemeSelection.ts     # chrome.storage.local read/write; missing selection falls back to Bauhaus
├── useStripTokens.ts        # Shared dark CTA strip color pair (used in 8+ places)
├── bootstrap.ts             # Pre-React paint sync to avoid theme flash
├── themes/
│   ├── bauhaus.ts           # Light geometric fallback for existing installs with no stored selection
│   └── midnight.ts          # Default dark theme for fresh installs
└── primitives/              # Theme-aware atoms (ThemedCard, ThemedField, IconBox, …)
```

**Pre-paint flow:** `index.tsx` and `onboarding.tsx` call `bootstrapThemeAttribute()`
synchronously before React renders, which reads a localStorage mirror of the
canonical `chrome.storage.local` selection and sets `<html data-theme=...>`.
The CSS in `index.css` / `onboarding.css` uses theme-attribute selectors so
the very first paint matches the user's choice — no flash of the wrong theme.
Fresh installs initialize `selectedThemeId` to Midnight from the service
worker/onboarding path. Existing installs that predate the setting and still
lack `selectedThemeId` fall back to Bauhaus so updates do not auto-change their
appearance.

**Component contract:** Components must consume **intent tokens** —
`accent.primary`, `surface.raised`, `chart.numeric`, etc. — never theme-color
literals or names like `bauhaus.red`. The factory translates tokens to a
Chakra theme per the active `ThemeTokens` shape. To add a new theme, drop a
file in `themes/` satisfying the contract and register it in `ThemeProvider.tsx`.
Zero component edits.

For dark-theme-specific behavior, use `isDarkThemeId(themeId)` or
`tokens.colorMode === "dark"` instead of comparing directly to `"midnight"`.
This keeps future dark variants on the same contrast/ornament rules.

### Mobile screen layer

`apps/extension/src/components/ui/` is the public, domain-free mobile
application layer. It contains the screen/header/body/sticky-action shell,
separator-based list slots, empty/loading states, a full-screen picker, and a
bottom action sheet. These components accept renderable content and callbacks;
they never own wallet, transaction, message, storage, or signing state.

`components/ScreenTransition.tsx` remains the production screen-stack owner.
Hierarchy transitions move horizontally, root/auth replacement fades, covered
layers are inert, and the shared `data-screen-scroll-owner` /
`data-screen-heading` hooks support scroll and focus restoration. See
`_docs/STYLING.md` for component anatomy and `_docs/IMPROVE_UI.md` for the
frozen Phase 2 contract. Before a forward destination covers the current
screen, focus is released from the outgoing descendant; `inert` alone removes
that covered layer from focus and the accessibility tree without a redundant
`aria-hidden` conflict.

### Public/private home boundary

The unlocked home has one persisted presentation mode, `walletHomeModeV1`,
with fail-safe `public` fallback. `App.tsx` renders the `WalletModeToggle`
inside the balance heading: below the account selector in Public and at the
same position in Private. Public mode retains the active-account selector,
account portfolio/chart, positions, public assets, public Activity,
connected-app dock, and normal Send/Swap actions. Private mode deliberately
removes those account-scoped surfaces and replaces them with
`app/home/PrivatePortfolioHome.tsx`: the wallet-wide Privacy Pools USD/ETH
balance, its encrypted chart, separate `Shield` and `Unshield` actions, one
Shielded ETH asset row, and privacy-only Activity. Dapps and provider account routing
remain public-account scoped regardless of the visible mode.
The Firefox build currently exposes Public mode only: the home-mode hook
coerces persisted or requested Private mode back to `public`, while the renderer
hides both the mode toggle and the public-home Shield quick action. Chromium
builds retain the complete Public/Private switch and Shield entry point.
Private Assets deliberately omits native ETH and every other public-account
holding; the mode has no selected-account balance concept and does not receive
the active public address.
The heading uses the compact, non-wrapping label `Private Balance`; its
hover/focus help clarifies that the Privacy Pools total is not tied to any
single account.

The mode control is a tooltip-free, 28px amber-selected two-state pill on the
normal Warm Midnight base canvas. Private does not repaint the page or introduce a
parallel button style: its two actions reuse the same icon, 40px action tile,
type, hover, and pressed treatment as the public home actions. Its headline
USD value and chart represent only ASP-cleared `readyBalanceWei`; a locally
reserved `withdrawal_pending` commitment remains in this displayed total until
its withdrawal confirms, while `maxPrivateSendWei` excludes it so it cannot be
spent twice. Compact subcopy separates the shielded amount from amber
`pendingBalanceWei` processing under the compliance check.
After an authenticated read, the background keeps one bounded, aggregate-only
private portfolio view in session storage: ready/pending/recoverable totals and
the already-released chart series. Automatic auth expiry removes every signing,
proof, note, and privacy-key capability but does not blank this read-only view,
so Private mode behaves like the public portfolio while an existing browser
session remains open. The renderer also retains the last parsed aggregate and
series in module memory across Private Home, Shield, and Unshield remounts.
Returning Home paints that verified value and chart synchronously; it does not
restart a sync solely because navigation changed. Explicit operation refreshes,
transaction-history broadcasts, and pending-operation timers replace the
snapshot in the background without re-entering a skeleton state. The shared
chart likewise initializes supplied private snapshots on its first render,
while its public-address storage path remains unchanged. A wallet-lock broadcast
clears the renderer copy. Explicit lock, browser shutdown, wallet reset, and Shield
recovery replacement clear the view cache. If no released session view exists,
the locked read still derives only confirmed and ASP-pending totals from the
sanitized public Shield operation records that drive Activity. The cache never
contains a commitment, note linkage, depositor, proof, key, or recovery data;
Unshield and public recovery remain master-authorized background operations.

Choosing Private also sends a fire-and-forget, wallet-UI-only
`privacyEnsureInitialized` request. The mode transition never waits for setup
and never receives secret material. The background performs the existing
master-authorized, custody-account-gated, idempotent initialization; the Shield
screen keeps its status and Retry request as the visible fallback.

Shielded ETH is therefore not injected into public Holdings, low-value groups,
network totals, generic Send, or generic Swap. The private home owns its single
asset identity and exposes only Shield, Unshield, and Activity. Private Activity
ignores the selected public address and includes exact-bound Shield/public
recovery transactions plus sanitized relay- and receiver-paid withdrawals
across the one local privacy identity. Public Activity remains signer-scoped:
every real transaction initiated by the selected account also appears there,
including Shield, single or batch public exit, and receiver-paid Unshield.
Relayed Unshield has no user-account transaction and remains Private-only.
Private Home owns its selected Assets/Activity tab above Shield-screen and
confirmation remounts. A successful Shield deposit or public recovery selects
and persists Private wallet mode with its Activity tab selected, including the
popup path that closes after confirmation. A rejected prompt preserves the
current mode and tab and is omitted from Private Activity. Receiver-paid Unshield
keeps its internal rejected operation long enough to release the claimed private
commitment, but the public operation-list projection excludes that explicit
wallet-rejected, hashless record. Other definite submission failures remain visible
for diagnosis, and ambiguous broadcasts remain pending for reconciliation. Every
exact WalletChan Shield origin uses the shared privacy mark; the public recovery
confirmation is presented concisely as `Shield Recovery`.

`privacyListShieldOperations` also returns an eight-day, at-most-hourly private
USD series. `chrome/privacy/portfolioHistory/` stores each balance/price point
in `walletchan-privacy-portfolio-v1` using fresh-IV AES-GCM under the dedicated
privacy key with header-bound AAD; only timestamp and record/key identifiers
are public storage metadata. Balance changes create an immediate point, hourly
reads refresh price, and the store retains at most 193 records. Reset and phrase
replacement delete the database. The renderer receives only bounded decrypted
`{timestamp,totalValueUsd}` points after the background verifies the current
privacy vault/key binding. Ready-balance changes create the immediate points;
processing deposits do not increase the headline or chart until ASP clearance.
Every durable encrypted commitment mutation broadcasts the payload-free
`privacyPortfolioUpdated` invalidation. Open Private Home surfaces debounce the
signal and reload the aggregate and chart directly, so ASP-cleared Shields and
both direct and relayed successful Unshields update Assets without depending on
a public transaction-history event or manual refresh.
The most recently released bounded series is mirrored into
`chrome.storage.session.privacyPortfolioViewV1` with the aggregate portfolio so
automatic auth expiry can keep rendering it without decrypting this database.

### Shield initialization boundary

`components/ShieldView.tsx` is the stable lazy-route facade for the
`components/Shield/` feature domain. The build-profile renderer routes Shield,
Unshield, and deposit status to focused feature screens. Privacy Pools v1
has no in-pool transfer, so Private mode does not expose a duplicate Send route. Entering
Private mode starts the wallet-UI-only `privacyEnsureInitialized` request in
the background; the Shield screen repeats it to expose bounded status and Retry.
The Private Home action rail exposes three equal actions: `Shield`, `Unshield`,
and `Deposits`. Deposits opens the existing master-authorized, account-grouped
public-exit deposit selector directly, including its same-account 2–8 deposit
batch selection. Privacy Pools recovery remains available through the global
Settings screen and is not duplicated in this action rail. The Deposits
shortcut introduces no new message route or signing path.

The background
idempotently creates a separate encrypted Privacy Pools recovery phrase when a
live password or fresh biometric master session and custody account are
present, then returns only `ready` or a bounded action-required error. Existing
biometric factors that predate Shield create an empty passkey-only privacy-vault
scaffold during their next successful assertion; the first eligible Private-mode
entry fills its
encrypted recovery phrase without asking for the main password. Healthy
initialization adds no dashboard row; failures reuse the compact action-status
line with Retry. Ordinary Shield routes never receive phrases, keys, encrypted
records, or prover data. Settings -> Shield Recovery is the sole explicit
plaintext-release surface. Its entry screen offers separate backup and restore
paths. Backup requires the current main password, returns the phrase only to
the trusted top-level extension document, starts concealed behind an explicit
visibility control, marks the exact vault revision as backed up, and clears
renderer state when the leaf closes.

The restore path requires the current phrase to be revealed first, shows the
aggregate Shield balance at risk, and requires two explicit loss
acknowledgements before accepting a replacement. The background validates
BIP-39 and exact revision-bound backup proof before changing storage, repeats
master authorization after asynchronous work, encrypts a new vault revision,
preserves the existing key capability, and resets only rebuildable Privacy
Pools databases. The Settings renderer starts a bounded active-chain rescan only
after restore succeeds; abandoning the flow or submitting an invalid phrase
leaves the prior encrypted phrase untouched. A biometric-only compatibility vault can add its
missing main-password wrapper from the live fresh passkey capability plus the
explicitly verified password. `privacyRecoveryBackup` V2 stores only the exact
privacy key ID, vault revision, and verification time; it never stores the
phrase. V1 key-ID-only markers remain readable for compatibility but cannot
authorize phrase replacement.

Pressing Shield opens the inline amount form immediately, without blocking on
deployment reads or a fixed proof self-test. `hooks/useShieldQuote.ts` debounces
exact Shielded ETH input at or above the active manifest's onchain minimum (`0.001 ETH`
on Sepolia, `0.01 ETH` on mainnet) and sends wallet-UI-only
`privacyQuoteShield` with the current
`{ accountId, accountAddress, accountType }` snapshot. `privacy/deposit/quote.ts`
resolves that exact stored account, rejects impersonators, and supports Bankr,
private-key, seed-phrase, and Ledger public addresses. `quoteClient.ts` uses the same
bounded active-chain transport to read the public balance, estimate the standard fee
tier, and simulate the pinned Entrypoint `deposit(uint256)` call with the
canonical gross value that produces the entered shielded amount after fees,
plus a fresh throwaway public precommitment. The pure policy applies the active
manifest's onchain vetting fee on top of the entered amount (1% Sepolia, 0.5%
mainnet),
the existing 20% gas-limit buffer,
total-required check, and gas-aware net Max. At a one-wei fee-rounding
ambiguity, the balance-aware Max quote pins the exact available gross value
rather than the context-free upper value, so Max/100% consumes the complete
post-gas balance. Entering `0.01 ETH` on mainnet
therefore creates exactly `0.01 ETH` of Shielded ETH; the quote shows the
`0.000050251256281407 ETH` fee, while the normal transaction review shows the
chosen shielded amount and `0.010050251256281407 ETH` gross wallet debit without
a redundant fee row. Network names, explorer links, private Activity filtering,
recovery scan copy, and all Shield progress copy derive from the compile-time
deployment profile (or the transaction's pinned chain name for history). It deliberately does not adopt the
official website's app-only `1 ETH` preference; amounts are limited only by
valid `uint256` input and the source balance after gas. All returned integers
are decimal strings. No privacy phrase, derived commitment, signer, pending
transaction, operation storage, confirmation control, or submission function
is reachable from this route.

The final durable preparation resolves a user-configured active-chain RPC or
WalletChan's immutable known-chain default, reads the 14 fixed deployment
fields in JSON-RPC batches capped at three requests, and verifies the exact
chain, proxy/implementation, pool, scope, asset, verifiers, configuration, and
runtime bytecode fingerprints before it can persist or queue anything. The
packaged fixed-proof readiness check remains available as a trusted diagnostic
route but is not part of the user-facing Shield interaction.

The amount panel's single `Continue` action sends
`privacyPrepareShieldReview` with the public gross value pinned by the accepted
quote. This separate background path requires a live
password or fresh biometric master session, then holds the wallet-secret lock
while it rechecks the auth epoch, re-pins the exact stored account, decrypts
the Privacy Pools recovery phrase, and derives a disposable deposit
precommitment at the reserved final uint32 derivation index. It ABI-encodes the
pinned Entrypoint `deposit(uint256)` call and
independently decodes the exact selector, one-word argument, source,
destination, chain, transaction value, and fee math. The internal review type
is explicitly `submittable: false`; the router strips calldata and commitment
material and returns only the public account, gross amount, protocol fee,
shielded amount, and destination tuple. No storage
write, pending request, signature, confirmation route, or RPC submission occurs.

The review's `Confirm details` action sends `privacyPrepareShield` with a
renderer-stable UUID and the same public gross quote pin. The background
repeats the live deployment, quote,
master-epoch, exact stored-account, and dedicated privacy-key checks, and
derives a distinct durable index. A fresh matching biometric master session can
prepare this operation without first adding a main-password wrapper; plaintext
recovery reveal remains explicitly main-password-gated. Under the wallet-secret
lock it encrypts the real deposit index, precommitment, and exact calldata with
the dedicated privacy key. `privacy/operations/repository.ts`
then atomically advances `nextDepositIndex` and adds the operation in the
active profile's IndexedDB (`walletchan-privacy-v1` on Sepolia,
`walletchan-privacy-mainnet-v1` on mainnet). The request UUID is the sole
idempotency identity: retrying it returns the exact durable operation, while a
fresh UUID always reserves a distinct index even when the account and amount
match an operation awaiting confirmation, submission, receipt indexing, or
ASP review. The stored account/amount key remains validation metadata only. After a
rejection is durably marked and its
pending transaction is removed, WalletChan deletes the encrypted rejected
operation while keeping `nextDepositIndex` advanced; activity reads hide
rejected attempts. Startup removes any orphaned pending prompt before
pruning rejected rows left by older builds. A retry finds and account-validates that exact durable
operation before another deployment/quote RPC pass. Only the sanitized public
summary is returned. The background then creates a trusted, pinned normal
WalletChan transaction request without repeating deployment verification;
durable preparation already verified it, and the eventual Confirm authority
gate verifies it again before signing or submission. The pending-request
runtime event immediately updates the open renderer's in-memory queue, while
the subsequent `chrome.storage.local` change remains authoritative. This
prevents a fast Review → Back → Shield sequence from missing the saved request
and starting preparation again. Private-key, seed-phrase, and Ledger accounts
repeat the encrypted intent, account, deployment, and master-epoch checks at
confirmation and immediately before raw RPC publication. Ledger retains the
pending request throughout hardware approval and crosses the privacy effect
boundary only after the recovered device signature and final account/origin
authorization pass. Sepolia development builds reject Bankr before a prompt.
Production mainnet builds admit Bankr through the ordinary account-pinned
Bankr confirmation path, perform the same privacy authorization before pending
request removal, and begin the encrypted privacy effect before Bankr's
irreversible submit boundary. Receipt polling verifies the exact ETH-pool
`Deposited` event; bounded pool-log sync and encrypted phrase rescan can rebuild
the same commitment after UI/service-worker restart or disposable cache loss.

`privacySyncShield` first materializes already-indexed deposits and resumes
Unshield/ragequit receipt recovery before any event or ASP request can fail.
It then advances the public event checkpoint, matches deposit precommitments,
and, only when the safe event cache is current, rebuilds every known local
lineage through all matching `Withdrawn` and `Ragequit` events. A second
materialization/receipt pass runs before ASP eligibility refresh. This ordering
prevents an ASP outage or malformed duplicate from blocking a confirmed
receiver-paid receipt, and prevents a fresh mainnet-history backfill from
holding a known approved deposit in the compliance-pending state. Local
materialization runs before ASP transport. The public-withdrawal
choice may use the exact account-bound indexed operation while that local
commit is catching up, and `privacyPrepareRagequit` repeats materialization
before proof preparation. A pending Shield transaction's `Cancel Shielding and
Withdraw?` entry carries its exact operation ID and net Shielded ETH amount into
Unshield. The renderer prefills that exact amount and keeps the matching public
exit primary even when unrelated ready private funds exist; the background
accepts the operation ID only as a selector and binds it back to the encrypted
commitment's `sourceOperationId` before proof preparation. It then verifies
strict ASP responses by matching the association root to
`Entrypoint.latestRoot()` exactly and accepting the state root only when it is
the pool's current root or one of the other 63 roots retained in the deployed
64-slot circular history. This mirrors the withdrawal contract: association
roots are latest-only, while state proofs may use any still-known pool root.
The same two checks run again immediately before relayer submission. The sync
then maintains that commitment's eligibility state. The renderer sees
only aggregate ready and pending balances plus the active original depositor's
recoverable balance. `privacyPrepareUnshieldQuote`
selects the smallest sufficient ready commitment in the background and validates an
expiring, EIP-712-signed quote from the pinned relayer set. While the relay
method remains selected, the review schedules one renderer request for a fresh
quote at the accepted quote's expiry; switching back from a direct method also
refreshes an already-expired relay quote immediately. The transition is shown
as a non-interactive refreshing state, while bounded transport or validation
failures retain the existing explicit retry path. If no quote fits the
Entrypoint's `maxRelayFeeBPS`, the relayer client still completes every other
signature, recipient, asset, amount, expiry, gas, and fee-data check, then
returns the cheapest verified over-cap quote as a bounded
`relay-fee-cap-exceeded` warning. The router exposes only relay name, quoted
BPS, and the pinned onchain maximum; it creates and stores no Unshield
operation. The renderer keeps the amount/address entry screen stable and shows
the diagnostic only on the fresh Unshield review instead of the misleading
generic quote-unavailable error. For Unshield, that warning opts a `private_ready`
commitment into the existing original-depositor ragequit selector so the user
can explicitly withdraw publicly from review.

The review also offers `Receiver pays gas` when the recipient resolves to an
exact WalletChan signing account. `privacyPrepareDirectUnshield` accepts that
account snapshot only for this direct route, requires recipient and signer to
be the same address, derives and locally verifies the withdrawal proof with
`processooor = recipient` and empty context data, encodes the ETH-pool
`withdraw` call, and simulates that exact calldata from the receiving account.
It proceeds only when the account has enough native ETH for the buffered gas
estimate. The encrypted intent claims the commitment before it queues a normal
account-pinned transaction confirmation; queue failure compensates by releasing
the claim. Confirmation and the irreversible submit boundary recheck the exact
account, calldata, roots, privacy authorization epoch, and deployment. Bankr,
private-key, seed-phrase, and Ledger accounts then reuse their existing signing
paths; impersonators are rejected, and explicit Sepolia builds reject Bankr
mutation.
ASP refresh decisions are revision-and-status compare-and-set writes. A refresh
that began from an older `private_ready` snapshot cannot overwrite a newer
`withdrawal_pending` Unshield claim while the normal confirmation is open.
That local reservation does not lower the private headline or write a chart
point. Explicit wallet rejection restores the claim, removes any legacy chart
point written during its reservation window, invalidates the renderer snapshot,
and remains excluded from the public Activity projection. Hashless rejection
must not be reclassified by interrupted-submission recovery.
Receipt reconciliation expects the recipient as `processooor` and applies the
same spent-nullifier/replacement-commitment transition as relayed withdrawal.
Relay, receiver-paid, and public-exit preparation all derive the selected
note's current nullifier and read the pool's `nullifierHashes` mapping before
proof work and again at the final local claim boundary. A spent note or an RPC
that cannot prove spendability fails closed as `balance-syncing`; it is never
collapsed into the generic receiver-paid availability error.

The compact recovery row opens `privacyPreviewRagequit`, a read-only,
master-authorized list of every currently ragequittable whole commitment. Each
bounded row contains only an opaque commitment-record ID, local timestamp,
exact current amount, original amount, already-unshielded amount/count, and
original account/source-operation binding. The Public exit row keeps the
remaining amount primary and renders the original/consumed values as muted
history only for a partially consumed deposit. It does
not prove, persist a recovery intent, claim a commitment, or queue a
transaction. The dedicated Public exit review groups deposits by original
account and uses checkboxes for exact whole commitments. Once a group has a
selection, other account groups stay unavailable until it is cleared because
ragequit executes as the original depositor. One selection calls
`privacyPrepareRagequit` and retains the normal transaction request. Two to
eight selections call `privacyPrepareRagequitBatch`; the background rejects
empty, duplicate, mixed-account, stale, or amount-drifted selections and queues
one immutable atomic batch confirmation. Local private-key and seed-phrase
accounts use the existing EIP-7702/ERC-7821 sign-once path; production Bankr
uses its existing atomic batch submission path. Ledger uses the normal
single-transaction path and the review limits a Ledger selection to one
commitment because Ledger does not support WalletChan's EIP-7702/ERC-5792
atomic batch path; the background independently rejects a Ledger batch. Only
the acknowledged final action has proof, claim, persistence, or transaction
side effects.
There is deliberately no fee override because `Entrypoint.relay` reverts above
the onchain maximum. `privacyExecuteUnshield`
rechecks the quote economics, recipient, roots, state and ASP membership,
generates and locally verifies the withdrawal proof, validates all public
signals, persists the effect transition, and only then submits to the relayer.
Receipt/nullifier reconciliation applies the exact replacement commitment for
both partial and full withdrawal. The aggregate `readyBalanceWei` may span
several encrypted commitments and continues to include a locally reserved
commitment until onchain confirmation, while `maxPrivateSendWei` is the largest
single unreserved ready commitment. The withdrawal circuit consumes exactly one commitment per
proof, so Unshield presents these as `Total ready` and `Max` instead of implying
that the maximum is the user's whole balance. If the total is larger, an info
popover explains that subsequent withdrawals can consume the remaining
commitments. Receipt polling does not require unlock: it
binds the public Withdrawn event's amount and Entrypoint processooor to the
durable Unshield summary and may record `public_confirmed` while the privacy key
is cold. The encrypted spent-nullifier/replacement-commitment check and
`private_balance_updated` transition resume only after authentication.
Commitments are canonicalized by the immutable deposit lineage (profile/pool,
deposit transaction and index, label, and precommitment), not by a mutable
commitment hash. The highest verified withdrawal index is the only live note;
older records are quarantined as spent, same-index commitment forks fail
closed, and Shield materialization refuses to recreate an index-zero note once
that source operation or lineage already exists. Aggregate balance, largest
note, Unshield selection, public exit, ASP refresh, and account-removal safety
all consume that canonical view. A fully current event sync can recreate a
missing replacement note while preserving its source Shield operation ID.
The event scanner requests at most 1,000 inclusive blocks per `eth_getLogs`
page so the default public RPC is never probed with an unsupported range. A
page is retried smaller only for an explicit JSON-RPC range-limit response;
HTTP 429 and other transport failures defer the batch without a retry burst.
Each successful page atomically advances the public-event checkpoint. A sync run
remains capped at 64 pages. Normal receipt-complete Private Home sync does not
start this global history scan; it is a fallback only while a Shield operation
is `awaiting_event`, and a `partial` response schedules its next bounded batch.
Public Exit preview projects the authenticated local commitment set without
starting that backfill. A fallback transport failure is reported as
`unavailable` but does not block local receipt recovery, ASP refresh, portfolio
reads, or Public Exit preview. The final Public Exit preparation still checks
the selected current nullifier onchain before proving and again inside the
locked claim boundary.

While a confirmed, indexed commitment is awaiting ASP review, requires Proof
of Association, is declined or removed, or cannot be classified because the
ASP transport/root is unavailable, the dashboard shows one compact
public-withdrawal card. A successful label query may omit a newly confirmed
deposit until the ASP indexer sees it; this remains ordinary `awaiting_asp`
instead of being misclassified as an outage. A transport, invalid-response,
binding, or local root-verification failure becomes the internal retryable
`asp_unavailable` operation state; `poi_required`
becomes the distinct `asp_poi_required` action state instead of masquerading
as ordinary compliance queueing. A previously verified `private_ready`
commitment is not downgraded merely because a later ASP refresh is temporarily
unavailable. Both `awaiting_asp` and temporary `asp_unavailable` states use the
same simple `Compliance check pending` renderer copy and progress treatment;
the distinction remains available to background retry policy and diagnostics.
ASP console diagnostics contain only controlled phase names, aggregate counts,
and review-status counts—never labels, commitments, transaction hashes,
accounts, or amounts. The user
can keep waiting for private Unshield or return the commitment to its exact
original depositor immediately. The unavailable state is derived from the
exact local commitment lineage and never treats an unverified remote response
as approval.
`privacyPreviewRagequit` requires a live master session and returns every
current ragequittable whole commitment as a bounded opaque ID/timestamp/amount
plus original-account/source binding. It has no proof, recovery-intent
persistence, claim, pending request, or transaction effect. The router first
advances the bounded event cache, reconciles a fully current partial-withdrawal
lineage, and materializes indexed encrypted state so the displayed remainder
is current. A valid lookup with no current eligible commitments returns an
empty successful collection so Deposits can render `No active deposits`;
authorization, storage, and lookup failures remain explicit retryable errors.
`privacyPrepareRagequit` requires the same live master session
and control of the exact original depositor. It repeats the selected commitment
ID, reviewed amount, and source binding before any mutation. When transaction details supplies
a source Shield operation, recovery selects only its exact encrypted commitment
and fails closed instead of falling back to another deposit. It derives the current secrets even
after partial withdrawals, locally proves/verifies the four commitment signals,
and binds them in circuit order as commitment hash,
`Poseidon(nullifier)`, value, and label. The distinct deposit precommitment is
`Poseidon(nullifier, secret)` and is never substituted for the spent-nullifier
signal,
encrypts the operation, claims the commitment, and queues a trusted normal
transaction to the pinned ETH pool. Rejection/revert releases a pre-effect
claim; success requires the exact `Ragequit` event before the encrypted balance
becomes recovered and its source Shield activity becomes the terminal
`ragequit_recovered`/`Withdrawn publicly` state. `privacyListShieldOperations`
omits user-cancelled recovery prompts from Activity and returns only bounded public
projections of Shield, Unshield, recovery, and aggregate portfolio state.
`privacyPrepareRagequitBatch` applies the same checks to two through eight
whole commitments sharing one exact account/address/type. Every encrypted
operation binds the common batch ID in AES-GCM AAD. The pending batch stores the
canonical operation-ID/call order, is non-editable and non-splittable, and is
revalidated immediately before the atomic effect. Rejection or pre-effect
failure releases every claim; a submitted batch gives every operation the same
transaction hash. Receipt handling decodes all Ragequit logs and requires a
one-to-one exact account/commitment/label/value match before consuming each
local balance. Restart reconciliation groups events by transaction hash rather
than overwriting multiple events from one atomic receipt.
Single and atomic public-exit transaction-history rows persist only the
versioned `{version: 1}` `privacyRagequitMeta` marker. Activity uses that marker
to keep the public onchain recovery inside Private Activity and exclude it from
Public Activity. Exact legacy origins (`WalletChan Shield`, `WalletChan Shield
Recovery`, and `WalletChan Public Exit`) provide additive compatibility for
entries written before the marker existed; arbitrary substring matches are not
accepted.
The Shielded ETH balance is the aggregate already confirmed in the pinned pool,
regardless of ASP status. It combines verified commitment records
with newly confirmed/indexing operation sidecars and de-duplicates them by
source operation. A separate aggregate contains only the portion still awaiting
the ASP check; the renderer distinguishes total confirmed, ready, and pending
ETH, while relayed Unshield availability uses only the locally verified
`private_ready` balance. The private home renders this identity as its sole
asset; public portfolio and transfer models never receive it.
While Shield remains mounted, `useShieldOperations` reacts to matching
`txHistoryUpdated` events after the receipt mirror has settled, reloads before
and after the bounded `privacySyncShield` pass, retries active confirmation or
indexing state every 10 seconds, and checks ASP-pending, retrying, and
Proof-of-Association states at a restrained two-minute cadence. The screen
also consumes a lifecycle update immediately when it arrives during a
long-running mainnet event scan, so it advances without a close/reopen cycle
and without continuously hammering the configured RPC or ASP.
When no WalletChan view is mounted, a one-shot two-minute MV3 alarm wakes the
service worker only while a Shield operation remains `awaiting_asp`,
`asp_unavailable`, or `asp_poi_required`. The worker may restore an eligible
browser session, but it does not require one to verify the public operation
binding, ASP label membership, commitment membership, association root, and
known pool state root. That locked-safe verification advances the durable
operation to `asp_approved`; the first atomic transition emits one native
browser notification with generic copy and no amount, account, chain, label,
commitment, or other Shield metadata. Secret-derived lineage verification and
commitment materialization remain separate and advance `asp_approved` to
`private_ready` only with the authenticated privacy key. The alarm clears once
no public compliance work remains; a later unlock/screen sync performs the
private-ready reconciliation without weakening the public verification.
The same durable deposit state
is projected onto the matching normal `txHistory` row
after an exact operation/transaction/account/chain/value binding check. The
projection contains only operation ID, gross and net public amounts, lifecycle
state, and update time. Main wallet Activity renders `Shield ETH`, the amount as
a positive green addition to the private balance,
plain-language stage copy, and an unsegmented compliance indicator once the
deposit is confirmed onchain. The indicator uses the normal transaction's
`completedAt` receipt time against a one-hour estimate, reaches 90% after 54
minutes, and remains there until the public state becomes `asp_approved`; it
never presents the estimate as a completion guarantee.
Pending Activity uses one full-width `Compliance check pending` status row,
without a duplicate context label, while transaction details use
`Compliance check` with the existing pending spinner and show `Confirmed` only
after approval. The pending details header and status card share the review
surface's one-hour hover/focus explanation. The card identifies Privacy Pools
with its locally bundled official logo so the protocol, rather than WalletChan,
is visibly attributed as the check provider. A centered
`Cancel Shielding and Withdraw?` action remains available for every
publicly recoverable ASP state and navigates to the existing Unshield screen; it
does not submit a recovery or withdrawal from transaction details. Activity
continues opening the existing active-chain transaction-details screen, where
the same lifecycle projection is shown with the ordinary receipt data.
Sanitized relay- and receiver-paid withdrawals are merged as Unshield rows into
the private dated Activity list. Receiver-paid preparation publishes the
durable `awaiting_wallet_confirmation` operation into the renderer portfolio
snapshot before opening normal account-pinned transaction confirmation. That
lets the existing transaction-history broadcasts reload its Processing,
onchain-confirming, explorer-link, and terminal receipt states without a screen
remount. Receiver-paid submission distinguishes a definite pre-publication or
rejected submission from an ambiguous remote outcome: definite failures release
the claimed commitment and become retryable with `submission-failed`, while an
outcome that may have crossed the broadcast boundary remains
`submission_unknown` for nullifier reconciliation. A returned transaction hash
is persisted into the Unshield operation before receipt polling begins. Startup
recovery also gives the consumed-prompt-to-submission handoff a bounded grace
period, preventing normal sync from releasing the commitment between prompt
removal and the final broadcast gate. The ordinary transaction receipt
finalizer fans the same canonical receipt into Shield, Public Exit, and
receiver-paid Unshield mirrors; the dedicated Unshield poller remains only as
restart recovery. This prevents Public Activity from reaching Confirmed while
the Private operation remains submitted. Its
signer-owned transaction-history row also remains visible in that
account's Public Activity, while Private suppresses that duplicate in favor of
the richer Unshield operation row. Recipient copy uses the shared
account/contact address-label map. A successful relayer
submission immediately navigates to Private Activity. Row selection uses the
same full-screen transaction-detail route and back-navigation grammar as normal
transactions instead of a modal, while the live detail content retains the
withdrawal's route, fee, recipient, explorer, and status data. Its primary
balance-change receipt shows the exact Shielded ETH debit flowing into the
recipient's public ETH credit, the shared resolved destination control, and
renderer-only USD equivalents. Method, protocol, relay, and fee
metadata follow in the lower summary. The terminal
`private_balance_updated` state is presented as `Confirmed`. One private-home operation subscription updates
the balance, asset, chart, eligibility, withdrawal, and recovery presentation.
The submitted public withdrawal projection is written into the renderer memory
snapshot before navigation, and active withdrawal states reuse the existing
10-second sync cadence. This preserves the cached balance/chart while making
the submitted row and its live detail status visible immediately.

The Shield renderer uses a fixed Swap-style deposit grammar without internal
mode tabs. Its source field reuses Send's in-field ETH/USD switch when the
encrypted private-portfolio price read has a current ETH price. USD remains a
renderer-only denomination: the quote, review, durable operation, slider, and
transaction paths receive canonical ETH/wei. Recoverable form and operation
errors sit in one full-width row below the route metadata instead of competing
with the source balance. `Review shield` prepares
the bounded review and then queues the durable operation so the existing normal
transaction request is the single deposit review/confirmation. Its request
details identify the Privacy Pools route and a one-hour estimated compliance
time; the adjacent hover/focus popover explains that the check can take longer
and that public exit remains available. Backing out of
that normal confirmation leaves it pending; the next Shield entry reopens the
newest exact trusted Shield request instead of preparing another operation.
The background idempotency path likewise re-announces an exact stored pending
request without another deployment RPC read, while the eventual Confirm path
still repeats deployment and master-authorization checks before signing.
Standalone Unshield reuses Send's recipient/contact/ENS/contract-warning
controller but remains the sole v1 withdrawal surface. It starts with an empty
recipient and requires an explicit address/contact choice. Its entry screen
contains only the Shielded ETH amount and boxed `Receive at` destination.
Only this Unshield recipient chooser exposes a header Add account action. The
existing creation/import flow stays inside the mounted withdrawal composition:
Back restores the chooser and successful completion selects the exact returned
account address while the account-list broadcast refreshes its wallet row. The
row is then scrolled into view once, using instant movement when reduced motion
is preferred.
`Review unshield` opens the quote state on a separate screen, where exact from
and receiver amounts plus renderer-only USD equivalents appear once in the
outcome card. The entry amount field uses the same current private-portfolio
ETH price for a read-only USD equivalent without changing wei validation.
Request details starts
with a `Withdrawal method` selector. `Private relay` shows the quoted relay fee
as percentage plus ETH/USD value, immediately followed by a live Number Flow
`m:ss` expiry countdown, then relay identity, network, route, and privacy warnings.
`Receiver pays gas` shows full receiver proceeds,
no relay fee, the paying account, and the exact gas estimate once prepared,
plus a warning that the receiver publicly submits and receives the transaction.
The method sheet pairs those choices with radio-tower, fuel, and shield-off
marks so relay, gas payment, and public ragequit remain quickly distinguishable.
When the recipient exactly matches an original depositor with a recoverable
commitment, the selector also exposes `Public withdraw`; its subtext explicitly
names ragequit, whole-deposit exit, and public depositor linkage before opening
the existing recovery preview/review flow. An over-cap quote turns the relay
fee row semantic error red, adds the active contract limit, and keeps any
public-exit alternative in the sticky decision bar immediately above Back and
the amber `Check relay again` action. Signed quotes whose gas-derived fee reaches or
exceeds the withdrawal amount still take this bounded fee-cap diagnostic path;
they are not collapsed into generic quote failure. If every relay is genuinely
unavailable or fails verification, Request details retains network/route
context and the same public-exit fallback remains in the sticky bar. Back
invalidates an in-flight quote generation so a
late response cannot overwrite or reopen the entry form. The final review uses
a normal `Unshield` press action. No renderer
password, biometric, or hold gesture is added; background master authorization
is still required. Unshield spends
the wallet-wide privacy identity and is not bound to the active public account
or its custody type; Bankr and
impersonator selection therefore cannot redirect or veto the withdrawal. Agent
sessions remain blocked by the same master-authorization boundary. Shield and
public recovery still require an explicit internal signer: Shield presents an
active-chain source-account picker and public recovery resolves the exact original
depositor, without mutating the globally selected public account.
`privacyEnsureInitialized` returns a typed `auth-required` status whenever the
master/privacy capability is cold or the current session is restricted. Shield
and Unshield then replace the ambiguous operation error with an `Unlock
WalletChan to continue` action. Password and passkey success return to the same
privacy mode (and the exact transaction-selected public-exit target) and trigger
a fresh Shield sync. Public operation status observation and the background ASP
alarm remain independent of that unlock gate.

Unshield preserves that same inverse asset form even when no relayed balance is
ready. If ragequit is available, the source/outcome cards become a fixed
Shielded ETH -> active-chain ETH public-exit route to the original depositor.
Its action opens the same read-only whole-deposit review used by the secondary
fallback row; no proof or transaction request exists merely because the user
opened that review. The review states that ragequit cannot split a commitment,
shows the saved account name/avatar/address, and requires an unchecked public-
link acknowledgement before the final `Withdraw publicly` commitment. A ready
private balance keeps the relayed route primary and exposes public exit only as
a compact sticky review action when the verified relay quote exceeds the
onchain fee cap. The
editable source card validates its amount independently from the intentionally
blank recipient, and pending-deposit copy cannot replace the available-balance
state while ready funds exist.

After deployment verification, a background coordinator creates the Chrome
offscreen document with a fresh per-run nonce and sends one exact internal
message that the offscreen page accepts
only from the background service worker. The page dispatches fixed self-tests
or one exact bounded commitment/withdrawal input
to a packaged worker. The worker loads the pinned commitment/withdrawal
artifacts from the extension origin, repeats their size/SHA-256 checks, proves
the public upstream fixtures in forced single-thread mode, and verifies both
proofs locally. The UI receives only `ready` or a generic failure and reuses its
existing compact status line; proofs, public signals, fixtures, timings, and
errors stay outside the renderer. The offscreen document and worker are closed
after every bounded request so popup closure and worker restart are ordinary.
Real proof requests retry once with a newly created offscreen document before
failing. That retry is local-only and cannot repeat an RPC request, signature,
or onchain effect. The packaged runtime self-test also sends one normal fixed
commitment request through this production path and checks all four signals
against the shared primitive model instead of checking only proof validity or
the public value.
The service-worker console emits `[privacy-shield] prover` and
`[privacy-shield] public-recovery-proof` diagnostics with only a fixed stage,
proof action, retry number, and bounded failure code. It never logs proof
inputs/results, amounts, addresses, commitments, labels, or secret material.

The background Vite target aliases the official SDK root import to that pinned
package's pure `src/crypto.ts` module. The published root barrel eagerly
includes `snarkjs`/`ffjavascript`, whose Blob-worker bootstrap is invalid in an
MV3 service worker even when no proof API is called. A post-bundle boundary
fails the build if those worker markers reappear in `background.js`; proving
remains isolated to the offscreen worker target. The SDK's hashing import is
also bound to exact `poseidon-lite@0.3.0` functions for its only used input
widths, one through three. Fixed and differential vectors prove those outputs
against the official SDK while avoiding eager initialization of every wider
Poseidon parameter set whenever the service worker wakes.

The background-only `chrome/privacy/protocol/` boundary pins the official
`@0xbow/privacy-pools-core-sdk` dependency, exposes only bounded derivation and
commitment primitives, and validates a checked-in protocol manifest. Six
commitment/withdrawal circuit files live under
`public/privacy-pools/artifacts/`; `build:web` verifies their exact byte lengths
and SHA-256 hashes before copying them into the extension package, and the
runtime loader repeats those checks before releasing bytes. The artifacts are
not web-accessible resources and no remote fallback exists. The prover accepts
fixed readiness fixtures and exact bounded real commitment or withdrawal
inputs. It never receives the privacy phrase or ordinary wallet keys, makes no
network request, locally verifies every proof, and returns only the bounded
proof/signals required by the background coordinator. The ordinary readiness
route exposes only `ready` or a generic failure; a separate trusted-UI-only QA
route returns aggregate self-test timings without proof or inputs.

`privacy-prover.budgets.json` freezes one concurrent proof, package and bundle
ceilings, a 60-second first/restart self-test ceiling, and a 512 MiB Chromium
process-tree RSS-delta ceiling. `privacy-prover.distribution.json` records the
GPL-3.0-only v4 decision. Every build packages the complete GPL,
`snarkjs@0.7.5` attribution, and exact-version source directions. Release/store
targets require extension version 4.0.0 or later.

Account deletion invokes `privacy/accountSafety.ts` twice: before dapp
revocation and again inside the final account/secret mutation lock. It rejects
pending or ambiguous Shield operations, active public-recovery operations, any
unspent commitment, and identity states whose privacy key cannot be verified.
Reset first reads a public `privacyGetResetRisk` summary and requires an
explicit Shield-loss acknowledgement when any Shield data exists. Destructive
reset then deletes the vault, backup marker, and all rebuildable Privacy Pools
databases through the central reset manifest.

## Extension Preview Harness

The extension includes a Vite preview harness for fast theme iteration without
loading the browser extension:

```bash
pnpm dev:extension-preview
```

Open `http://localhost:4317/preview/all` to compare the key popup screens in
fixed popup/sidepanel frames. Each frame is an isolated iframe document, so
viewport units, Chakra breakpoints, portals, focus, body mode classes, and
scroll ownership use the real target dimensions rather than the outer gallery
viewport.

The harness lives in `apps/extension/src/preview/` and mounts production
controllers/components against deterministic URL-selected fixtures. Home uses
the production `App`; Settings and Portfolio use their production roots;
transaction detail, Swap/Bridge, standalone Swap picker, and confirmation
screens use their production components. A fail-closed Chrome and network
adapter supplies public fixture state, blocks real Bankr/RPC/API calls,
and reports unknown read dependencies instead of silently returning success.
Preview state is reproducible with `theme`, `frame`, `scenario`, and `wallet`
query parameters. See `_docs/EXTENSION_PREVIEW.md` for the workflow and rules
for adding preview screens.

The composed `/preview/mobile-primitives` route exercises the shared mobile
interaction grammar before individual production destinations adopt it. It is
not a synthetic replacement for any product screen.

See `_docs/STYLING.md` for the full token vocabulary and authoring rules.
See `_docs/THEMING_PRD.md` for the engine architecture and phased rollout history.

## Interaction Sounds

The renderer uses `cuelume` plus one WalletChan-owned Web Audio voice for a
deliberately small set of synthesized cues. Feature components never import
the package or custom synthesizer directly. They call
`playInteractionSound()` with a product-level cue from
`src/sounds/soundManager.ts`, which owns the cue-to-recipe mapping and applies
the global preference before playback.

`chrome.storage.local.soundsEnabled` is the canonical preference. Missing or
invalid values default to enabled, so this additive key needs no migration.
The manager listens to `chrome.storage.onChanged`, keeping popup, sidepanel, and
full-page extension views aligned. `useSoundsEnabled()` exposes the same state
to Settings → Sounds. Cuelume failures or browser autoplay restrictions remain
silent no-ops; sound never gates authentication or any other wallet behavior.

Current semantic cues:

| Cue | Cuelume recipe | Trigger |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `unlockSuccess` | `sparkle` | Successful password or biometric unlock; preview when interaction sounds are enabled |
| `transactionConfirm` | `sparkle` | User presses Confirm on a single, batch, or split transaction |
| `requestReceived` | `chime` | A dapp connection, transaction, signature, permission, asset-watch, or chain-add request reaches the renderer |
| `actionSheetTransition` | `bloom` | A bottom action sheet or connected-site chain drawer opens or closes |
| `chartValueChange` | Custom value pulse | Portfolio-chart NumberFlow value changes |
| `sliderValueChange` | Short custom tick | Send/Swap slider moves through non-snap values |
| `sliderSnap` | `release` | Send/Swap slider enters a different 0/25/50/75/100 snap stop |
| `portfolioTokenHover` | Custom value click | Fine-pointer entry into a portfolio token row, portfolio section tab, DeFi protocol link, or Activity entry; rate-limited |
| `quickActionHover` | `press` | Fine-pointer entry into Send, Swap, Shield, or More; rate-limited |

The manager owns per-cue cooldowns and fine-pointer eligibility as well as the
recipe mapping. A newly opened renderer plays `requestReceived` when it
bootstraps with pending dapp work; an already-open renderer plays it from the
corresponding `newPending*` runtime message.

`customValueSound.ts` synthesizes the value sounds as a 520Hz sine routed
through a 1500Hz low-pass filter. The chart retains its 5ms attack and 45ms
decay; the slider uses a quieter 3ms attack and 18ms decay so adjacent movement
ticks stay discrete. Both semantic cues can evolve independently. The chart cue
is capped at one pulse per 26ms and plays only when the visible NumberFlow value
changes, not on every raw pointer event.

`useSliderValueSound()` normalizes raw slider input before state updates or
playback. Values within three percentage points of 0/25/50/75/100 collapse to
the same snap value, and repeated events for that normalized value return early
without rewriting the amount or replaying audio. Entering a different snap
stop plays Cuelume `release` once. Actual non-snap value changes play the short
`sliderValueChange` tick, capped at one per 26ms. The hook uses
Chakra's `onChangeStart`/`onChangeEnd` lifecycle rather than inferred pointer
state, so mouse, touch, and keyboard input follow the same rules. Its initial
0% value is seeded as the resting snap point, preventing Chakra's first value
callback from playing `release` before the user has actually moved the slider.

The same synthesizer exposes a portfolio-token value-click variant: the same
520Hz sine and 1500Hz low-pass with a 2ms attack, 12ms decay, and 0.02 peak
gain. It retains the token-hover cue's fine-pointer gating and 140ms cooldown.

New cues should be added to the central mapping only after confirming they fit
the restraint rules in `_docs/WARM_MIDNIGHT.md`.

## Account Types

### Send entry selection

- The homepage Send quick action opens with Ethereum mainnet (`chainId: 1`)
  and its native ETH token, independent of the homepage's current chain state.
- Sending from an Assets row preserves that row's exact token and chain.
- The initial native placeholder is refreshed from the shared portfolio token
  catalog after load so current balance, price, and metadata replace its
  zero-value bootstrap fields without changing the selected asset identity.
- For native assets, Send's MAX action and 100% slider reserve gas before
  filling the input. The renderer reuses the trusted-wallet gas estimator,
  prices its already-buffered gas limit at the highest available fee tier,
  adds 10% fee headroom, and subtracts the result with bigint precision. The
  estimate refreshes for the resolved recipient or calldata; ERC-20 MAX remains
  the full token balance.

The extension supports six distinct account models that can be used
simultaneously:

| Feature               | Private Key Account                 | Seed Phrase Account                   | Ledger Account                         | Impersonator Account                 | Safe Account                              | Bankr API Account          |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Transaction Execution | Local signing + RPC broadcast       | Local signing + RPC broadcast         | Device signing + RPC broadcast         | Fork RPC only, per-endpoint opt-in   | Proposal, owner quorum, then execution    | Via Bankr API              |
| Message Signing       | ✅ Full support                     | ✅ Full support                       | ✅ Personal sign + EIP-712             | ❌ Disabled (view-only)              | ❌ Disabled                              | ✅ Via API (`/wallet/sign`) |
| Privacy Pools         | ✅ Shield/Unshield/public exit       | ✅ Shield/Unshield/public exit         | ✅ Device-signed single transactions   | ❌ Disabled (view-only)              | ❌ Disabled                              | ✅ Mainnet mutations        |
| Key Storage           | Private key encrypted locally       | Mnemonic + derived keys encrypted     | Keys remain on device; public metadata only | No secrets stored               | No Safe secret; verified public metadata | API key encrypted locally  |
| Setup                 | Private key import or generate      | 12-word BIP39 import or generate      | Chrome WebHID pairing + address scan   | Address only                         | Discover or import an existing Safe       | API key + wallet address   |
| Use Case              | Agent wallets, bots, standard usage | HD wallets, multiple derived accounts | Hardware-backed daily signing          | Viewing portfolio/dApps              | Shared-control multisig workflows         | Optional remote signing    |

### Pending Transaction Replacement

Ordinary pending transactions signed by Private Key, Seed Phrase, and Ledger
accounts expose **Cancel** and **Speed Up** in Transaction details. Bankr,
impersonator, fee-token/UserOperation, force-inclusion, already-superseded,
access-list, type-3, and type-4 submissions do not enter this path.

`prepareTransactionReplacement` is a trusted-wallet-UI route that accepts only
the stored history ID and replacement kind. The service worker resolves the
exact history-bound account and configured RPC, requires a still-unmined RPC
transaction with the same hash/from/chain, and requires its nonce to equal the
account's `latest` count so an older queued nonce is handled first. Speed Up
copies the RPC transaction's to/value/calldata/gas; Cancel creates a zero-value,
empty-calldata self-transfer. Both reuse the exact pending nonce.

Replacement priority fee is rounded up by 12.5%, safely above geth's common
10% price-bump threshold. Max fee is rounded up by 30%, then both suggestions
are raised to the current Fast tier/base-fee headroom when that is higher. The
background stores the minimum replacement fee floor in the pinned request.
The normal transaction confirmation screen preselects those fees, keeps gas
editable above the floor, locks the replacement nonce and transaction content,
and revalidates the exact nonce plus fee floor in the PK/seed/Ledger confirmation
handlers before any key or device signing begins.

Back from pending transaction details, plus Back or Reject from either
replacement review, returns to Home with Activity selected. Replacement Reject
pre-navigates before durable prompt removal, and Home resolves its monotonic
Activity/Holdings triggers by whichever counter is newer.

### Ledger Architecture

- **Browser boundary:** Ledger setup and signing require Chromium with WebHID
  and `chrome.offscreen` (Chrome 124+). Firefox keeps all non-Ledger wallet
  behavior but does not advertise Ledger setup.
- **Setup surface:** selecting Ledger from a popup or side panel opens the
  dedicated `index.html?route=add-ledger` full-tab route. A side-panel launcher
  closes through the shared side-panel control after the tab opens. The route
  persists across unlock and takes priority over normal pending-request startup
  routing.
- **First-account onboarding:** Chromium onboarding already runs in a full
  extension tab, so Ledger appears after View-only in the initial account list.
  The shared Ledger flow pairs and scans there, retains only selected public
  device/path metadata in renderer state, then defers `addLedgerAccounts` until
  the master credential has been initialized inside the rollback-safe
  onboarding transaction. Unsupported browsers do not advertise the option.
- **Permission gesture:** the full-tab `components/Ledger/AddLedgerFlow.tsx`
  calls `navigator.hid.requestDevice()` only from the Connect button's user
  gesture. Popup and side-panel contexts never request WebHID permission.
- **Transport isolation:** `chrome/ledger/offscreenBridge.ts` lazily creates
  `offscreen.html`; `src/offscreen/ledgerSigner.ts` owns the Ledger SDK and
  WebHID session. Its message listener authorizes the exact extension ID and
  service-worker script URL before dispatch, rejecting UI/content-script and
  URL-lookalike senders. The document closes after 30 seconds idle.
- **Device binding:** the stable device identity is the lowercase address at
  `m/44'/60'/0'/0/0`. Every scan/sign session re-derives and checks it before
  using the connected device.
- **Persistence:** Ledger accounts extend public `accounts` metadata with
  `deviceId`, `hdPath`, and `hdIndex`. `ledgerDevices` stores only public label,
  model, and creation metadata; no hardware secret enters extension storage.
  Account/device persistence is the import commit boundary; active-account
  selection is best-effort after commit and cannot turn a successful import
  into a false failure.
- **Authority:** adding Ledger accounts requires a live master session. Signing
  works under master or agent sessions and retains the normal pinned-account,
  origin/WalletConnect, reset lease, signer-recovery, history, and receipt gates.
- **Privacy Pools:** Ledger is an eligible Shield source and receiver-paid
  Unshield/public-exit signer. Its single-transaction confirmation additionally
  revalidates the encrypted privacy intent before the hardware prompt, begins
  the privacy lifecycle only at the final pre-broadcast boundary, and records
  the submitted hash after broadcast. Public exit is one Ledger transaction per
  commitment because the atomic batch path remains excluded.
- **Safe:** Ledger addresses participate in owner discovery and Safe capability
  derivation. Owner approval builds the same chain-bound SafeTx EIP-712 payload
  as Bankr/local owners, then delegates device signing and recovered-address
  verification to `ledger/signing.ts`. At quorum, a Ledger account may also pay
  native gas for the outer `execTransaction` through the existing
  sign-once/broadcast path. The Safe proposal claim, live authority checks,
  exact-envelope simulation, durable signed bytes, receipt reconciliation, and
  Activity publication remain owned by the Safe domain. Ledger does not enter
  Safe token-gas execution because that route requires EIP-7702.
- **Hardware-wait boundary:** transaction and signature rows remain pending
  while the Ledger device is waiting for approval, so the request review stays
  mounted. The UI shows a Ledger action banner with the branded black logo tile
  and dark trailing spinner, changes the primary action to a dark three-dot `Waiting`
  state, and keeps the broadcast-only submitting banner hidden. Approval, gas,
  queue, rejection, and warning-override controls are locked, while Back remains
  available and only navigates away from the still-active request. The background
  first-action claim independently rejects competing edits or terminal actions.
  A transaction moves into processing history only
  after the recovered hardware signature reaches the final pre-broadcast
  callback; a message request is removed only after final authorization passes.
  Safe device/preparation failures therefore leave the request available for a
  deliberate retry instead of creating a failed Activity row. Safe approval
  and execution reuse the same Ledger status treatment and lock their mutable
  decision controls during the hardware prompt. Device approval
  is bounded to ten minutes while the separate device-discovery deadline
  remains eight seconds.
- **Initial exclusions:** Ledger fails closed for ERC-5792/cross-dapp batches
  (including multi-commitment Privacy Pools public exits),
  EIP-7702/ERC-7715 authority, ERC-4337 token-funded gas (including addresses
  already delegated to WalletChan), force inclusion, sponsored transfers, and
  the direct in-extension swap shortcut. A dapp swap that submits one normal
  transaction uses the supported single-transaction path.

Wallet-UI messages `ledgerConnect`, `ledgerScan`, `ledgerCancel`,
`addLedgerAccounts`, and `getLedgerDevices` are handled by
`background/ledgerRouter.ts`. A pinned Ledger transaction confirms through
`confirmTransactionAsyncLedger`; Ledger signatures branch inside the existing
trusted `confirmSignatureRequest` route.

### Seed Phrase Architecture

- **BIP39**: 12-word mnemonics (128-bit entropy) using `@scure/bip39`
- **BIP44**: Derivation path `m/44'/60'/0'/0/{index}` using `@scure/bip32`
- **Seed Groups**: Each mnemonic creates a "group" that can derive multiple accounts. Groups have user-editable names (default "Seed #N").
- **Storage**: Mnemonics are encrypted separately in `mnemonicVault`. V2 uses a dedicated random mnemonic key (not the general/agent vault key), with a master-password wrapper in the vault and an independent V2 passkey wrapper. Each phrase ciphertext is bound to its key/group ID with AES-GCM AAD. V1 master-password-encrypted entries remain readable and are converted to V2 only during an atomic successful passkey setup; password-only users are not rewritten on unlock. V1 passkey records existed only in unreleased/local development builds. They remain readable to avoid stranding developer profiles, but all new local-account setup is intentionally upgrade-gated until biometric unlock is re-enabled as V2. Derived private keys remain in `pkVault` for routine signing.
- **Byte conversion**: Uses native `bytesToHex()` from `cryptoUtils.ts` instead of Node.js `Buffer` (not available in browser service worker)
- **Files**: the stable `mnemonicStorage.ts` encrypted-vault facade over the `mnemonic/` audit domain: `derivation.ts` (BIP39/44), `record.ts` / `crypto.ts` / `repository.ts` / `operations.ts` / `recovery.ts` (encrypted storage and recovery), `masterAccess.ts` (master-only call-stack capability), `integrity.ts` (master-wrapper/account proof), `addressPreview.ts` (secret-free public address derivation), `accountPersistence.ts` (shared collision, compensation, and cache-refresh boundary), and `accountHandlers.ts` (add/derive orchestration). UI entry points remain `SeedPhraseSetup.tsx` and `RevealSeedPhraseModal.tsx`.
- **Display**: Account dropdown shows seed group name + derivation index (e.g., "Seed #1 · #0"). Account settings shows derivation index in type label.
- **Generated phrase setup order**: Settings → Add Account generates and shows
  the recovery phrase first. After the user acknowledges saving it, a separate
  optional naming step labels the seed group and its first derived account.
  The mnemonic remains only in renderer memory until that final step submits
  `addSeedPhraseGroup`; backing out before submission persists nothing. The
  generated phrase starts concealed, and an amber backup checkbox in the
  sticky action region must be checked before Continue advances to naming.
- **Address picker (shared)**: `components/SeedAddressPicker.tsx` is the single picker UI used by both flows: (1) new-import in `SeedPhraseSetup`, and (2) "Derive Addresses" on an existing seed group in `AddAccount`. Each row renders avatar (ENS or blockie), ENS name, BIP44 index, truncated address, portfolio USD total (`fetchPortfolio`, aborted on unmount), a copy button, and an Etherscan-mainnet link. Selected new addresses use the amber commitment checkbox treatment, and the import/derive submit action uses `brand`. The picker calls the background `previewSeedAddresses` handler, which accepts EITHER a raw `mnemonic` (import flow, no auth) OR a `seedGroupId` (existing-group flow, decrypts the stored mnemonic — requires an unlocked master session, including biometric). Paginates 5 at a time. Existing-group mode initial-fetches `0..maxExistingIndex + 5` so users see their already-added real accounts in context (locked as "added"). `addSeedPhraseGroup` and `deriveSeedAccount` both accept `indices: number[]` — bankr/seed collisions are silently skipped, PK collisions still convert in place, and view-only impersonators are ignored so they can coexist with imported seed accounts. `addSeedPhraseGroup` prevalidates that at least one selected index can be imported or converted before creating a seed group or writing `mnemonicVault`; duplicate-only imports fail without persisting seed material. Generate flow is unchanged (always derives index 0; nothing to discover on a fresh mnemonic).

#### PK → Seed Phrase Account Conversion

When importing a seed phrase whose derived address matches an existing private key account, the extension converts the PK account to a seed phrase account **in-place** rather than creating a duplicate or throwing an error:

1. Derive private key + address at index N as usual
2. Check if the address already exists in non-impersonator accounts
3. If it matches a `privateKey` account → call `convertToSeedPhraseAccount()` to update type, add seedGroupId/derivationIndex, preserve same account ID, display name, and vault entry. Skip `addKeyToVault` (key already in vault under same ID).
4. If it matches a `bankr` or `seedPhrase` account → skip/error as a duplicate; if it matches only a view-only `impersonator`, import the seed account alongside it
5. This applies to both `addSeedPhraseGroup` (index 0) and `deriveSeedAccount` (index N) handlers

### Account Selection

- Users can configure supported account types during onboarding and add Ledger
  or view-only accounts later from Account Settings
- When both accounts are set up, the first account added becomes the default active account
- Only tabs whose current origin has an approved dapp connection (or an active
  connection prompt) maintain an account selection in `tabAccounts`. Their
  first scoped lookup snapshots the current global account so later global
  changes cannot redirect that dapp.
- Tabs without a connected dapp always resolve and update the shared global
  account. Activating or navigating an ordinary tab clears any stale per-tab
  override; rejecting/disconnecting a dapp does the same. Activating a connected
  dapp tab promotes its scoped account to the shared global fallback, so the
  next ordinary tab follows the most recently active connected account without
  retaining an account of its own.
- The popup/sidepanel resolves the account for the currently active browser tab,
  including when rendered from a detached extension popup.
- Provider initialization, `eth_accounts`, connection approval, transaction and
  signature intake, ERC-5792 capabilities/batches, and ERC-7715 all resolve the
  sender tab's account. Pending signing requests remain pinned to that account.
- Account switching emits `accountsChanged` only in that tab and only when its
  top-level origin has a dapp permission grant. Closing a tab removes its map.
- Removing an account first revokes every exact-origin dapp grant for currently
  connected tabs mapped to that account. Revocation emits `accountsChanged([])`
  before account metadata is deleted; the tab is never silently remapped to the
  wallet's unrelated global fallback account. Because grants are origin-wide,
  every open tab for an affected exact origin is disconnected together. A
  pending connection prompt whose tab selected the removed account is cancelled
  with `4100`; connection approval and removal share one account-binding lock,
  so a queued approval cannot grant the fallback account after deletion.

### Address Synchronization

The extension maintains address consistency between storage and the active account:

1. **On Onboarding**: When both account types are configured, the first account's address (PK account) is saved to `chrome.storage.sync.address` since it becomes the active account.

2. **On Account Switch**: The extension asks the background worker to select
   the account for the active browser tab. `accounts/tabResolver.ts` stores a
   `tabAccounts` override only when that tab has a connected/pending dapp;
   otherwise it clears any stale override and updates the shared
   `activeAccountId` / `address` / `displayAddress`. A connected-tab selection
   also refreshes those global fallback fields while preserving every other
   connected tab's override. The UI sends `setAccount` only to the selected tab.
   Global address writes are never broadcast to every tab.

3. **On Bankr API Key & Address Change**: The Account Settings form calls
   `saveBankrApiKeyAndAddress`, which saves the new API key and updates the
   Bankr account's `accounts[].address` entry. If that account is active, the
   background worker also syncs `chrome.storage.sync.address/displayAddress`
   and broadcasts `accountsUpdated`.

4. **On Content Script Init**: `inject.ts` asks the background for the
   sender-bound tab account before announcing the provider. The global synced
   address is used only as a legacy fallback if no account metadata is available.

5. **On Address Change**: The inject.ts `setAddress` handler updates the provider's private address state for every tab, but emits `accountsChanged` only when the exact top-level site origin has a stored `dappPermissions` grant.

### Injected dapp connection permissions

- `eth_accounts` is a non-interactive privacy check. It returns `[]` until the exact trusted page origin has been approved.
- The first `eth_requestAccounts` call crosses `impersonator.ts` → `inject.ts` → `background.ts`, synchronously opens the side panel from the original page gesture when sidepanel mode is enabled, persists a durable `pendingDappConnectionRequests` record, and opens the extension connection-confirmation screen. A window-bound request-family hint makes a cold renderer wait for that queue so persistence cannot race panel startup. The prompt has no age-based timeout. Non-interactive `eth_accounts` reads and already-connected account requests never trigger the early open.
- Background derives the canonical `http(s)` origin, tab, and frame from `chrome.runtime.MessageSender`; page-provided origin values are never authorization inputs. Cross-origin/subframe requests currently fail closed and must connect from the top-level site.
- Approval stores an origin-only `dappPermissions` grant and resolves the request through `dappConnectionResult:{id}`. Future visits reuse the grant without prompting and receive the account currently selected for that tab/fallback active account.
- A pending connection request sets the Chrome action badge to `1` only when
  there are no pending transaction, signature, batch, ERC-7715 permission, or
  cross-dapp batch approvals. Connection requests never increment or replace
  the existing approval count; approving, rejecting, or explicitly
  invalidating the request
  refreshes the badge.
- Account switches remain visible to an approved origin through `accountsChanged`; unapproved origins receive no account-change event. Revocation sends `accountsChanged([])` to matching open tabs.
- The page-world provider exposes a getter-only MetaMask-compatible
  `selectedAddress` for legacy dapps that do not re-read `eth_accounts`. It is
  derived from the same origin-scoped provider state: `null` before approval
  and after an empty account result or revocation, otherwise the currently
  authorized account. The synced/global wallet fallback is never projected.
- Account removal uses the same exact-origin revocation path before deleting a
  mapped account, so it disconnects affected sites instead of exposing the next
  global account as an implicit replacement.
- Injected `eth_sendTransaction` and signature intake re-check the exact
  browser-attested, top-level sender origin against `dappPermissions` before a
  pending request is created. Page-provided `origin` fields are display-only;
  unconnected, subframe, and navigation-race requests fail with EIP-1193 code
  `4100` through the normal storage result channel.
- Site title and favicon are bounded, display-only metadata. The canonical hostname is always the primary identity in confirmation and management UI.
- Connection prompts opened from an exact `*.eth.limo` / `*.eth.link` origin
  always show a non-blocking contenthash provenance pill. Configured
  local/custom IPFS gateways show it while WalletChan Browser is enabled and
  the gateway maps back to a cached `.eth` IPFS/IPNS resolution.
  Trusted wallet UI calls `getEnsContenthashLastUpdated`; the service worker
  queries the ENS subgraph for the current resolver's newest
  `ContenthashChanged` block and resolves that block timestamp through the
  bounded Ethereum RPC client. The pill mounts immediately with `Checking…`,
  then shows the elapsed time or a quiet `Unavailable` state; network failure
  never delays connection approval. The background build accepts the
  public `VITE_THE_GRAPH_API_KEY` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_THE_GRAPH_API_KEY` used by
  swiss-knife and compiles it only into the service-worker bundle; without a
  configured key it falls back to the legacy public ENS subgraph endpoint.
- Every new connection prompt also performs a wallet-UI-only
  `getDappConnectionReputation` lookup. The renderer supplies only the opaque
  pending request ID; `dapp/reputationClient.ts` re-resolves the durable
  Chrome-attested hostname and concurrently queries WalletChan's bounded
  first-party `/api/domain-reputation` proxy plus the existing DefiLlama
  directory client. MetaMask blocklist and fuzzy matches always win. Otherwise,
  the Railway service's checked-in custom allowlist returns a trusted result;
  entries may opt into dot-boundary subdomain matching with
  `allowAllSubdomains`, and those results show `Verified domain`. If there is
  no custom match, an exact DefiLlama route-hostname match (with only `www.`
  normalization) shows `Listed on DeFiLlama` even when the negative-list
  request is unavailable or stale. Sites missing from both trusted sources show
  an amber warning when negative-list coverage is unavailable, or an ordinary
  unlisted warning after a fresh negative result. Known/fuzzy threats retain
  their red warning even from a stale last-known-good snapshot and require an
  explicit renderer
  acknowledgement before the trusted-UI Connect action is enabled. Network
  failure warns but does not prevent connection. Reputation is live
  presentation state and is never added to `dappPermissions` or
  `pendingDappConnectionRequests`.
- Request surfaces share the same origin presentation formatter. When
  WalletChan Browser is disabled, hosted and local gateway origins are not
  rewritten through the ENS resolution cache: connection, transaction,
  signature, batch, permission, watch-asset, pending-request, and activity
  identities show the literal requesting hostname. Hosted/local gateway marks
  use Chrome's processed favicon endpoint for that exact page URL, so display
  does not depend on a configured or running local IPFS gateway. Public
  `.eth.limo` / `.eth.link` origins retain their underlying ENS name only for
  contenthash provenance lookup even while their displayed identity is literal.
- Pending prompt storage is globally and per-origin bounded before mutation.
  Connection prompts allow one outstanding request per exact origin; add-chain
  and watch-asset prompts allow five per exact origin (with twenty globally).
  Existing transaction/signature/batch queues retain their stricter family
  limits. Capacity errors are returned durably to the waiting provider rather
  than silently dropping or replacing another origin's request.

### Transaction Routing

When a dApp initiates a transaction:

1. Extension checks the active account type for that tab
2. **Bankr Account**: Transaction submitted to Bankr API → API executes → returns tx hash
3. **PK Account**: Transaction signed locally with viem → broadcast to RPC → returns tx hash

For detailed implementation of private key accounts, see [PK_ACCOUNTS.md](./PK_ACCOUNTS.md).

## Architecture

### Source organization contract

Extension background logic is organized by audit domain, not by a flat prefix
convention. `apps/extension/src/chrome/README.md` is the root map. The
`src/chrome/` root is reserved for build entrypoints, documented compatibility
facades, and truly shared primitives; implementations belong in named folders
with a local `README.md` that records responsibilities, dependency direction,
effects, facade, and matching tests.

Implementation files stay below roughly 400 lines. Transitional composition
roots have enforced ratcheting budgets and may not grow while being decomposed.
A facade may preserve imports and exact export identities, but it owns no
authorization, cryptography, persistence, networking, or business policy.
Dependencies flow from entry router → domain coordinator → policy/repository or
pure transformation, never back toward the router.

Tests mirror the source domains under `apps/extension/tests/`; the test root is
kept empty, and every test domain has an audit-map README. Architecture tests
freeze facade identity, forbidden dependency direction, and size ceilings so a
later feature cannot silently collapse the domains back into a large file.

For any behavior-neutral move, storage keys, serialized records, message names,
public exports, and irreversible-effect ordering remain unchanged. A storage or
message-contract change is a separate migration/feature and follows the storage
and security checklists.

### Renderer source organization contract

The React renderer follows the parallel feature-domain contract in
[`EXTENSION_UI_ARCHITECTURE.md`](./EXTENSION_UI_ARCHITECTURE.md) and
`apps/extension/src/components/README.md`. `App.tsx` and page roots compose;
feature implementations live in named component folders with audit maps;
feature-only hooks and pure models stay colocated; `components/ui/` remains
domain-free. Existing flat imports may survive as re-export-only facades while
their implementations move incrementally.

New renderer implementation files stay below roughly 400 lines. Current
oversized screen roots have exact ratcheting budgets in
`tests/ui/moduleSizeBudget.test.ts` and may not grow. UI moves preserve props,
exports, lazy boundaries, request ordering, message/effect ordering,
popup-versus-sidepanel lifecycles, and Bankr/private-key/seed-phrase behavior.
Pure renderer models are covered with Node tests; visual behavior remains in
the production-backed preview and packaged extension QA.

Security-critical service-worker code follows the dependency and testing
contract in [`SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md`](./SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md). In
particular, message transport, authorization, domain orchestration, validated
storage, and cryptography are separate layers. Compatibility facades preserve
existing imports while large modules are decomposed incrementally; they must
not introduce new policy or persistence behavior.

`@metamask/delegation-deployments` `1.4.0` package predates that merge, so the
built-in registry pins the capability from the independent 2026-07-21 live
verification: both RPCs expose the expected v1.3.0 contract at
`EIP_7702_DEFAULT_DELEGATE` and return `true` for the plain ERC-7821 batch-mode
probe. Mainnet and testnet remain native-fee-only because authenticated Pimlico
discovery returned no fee tokens for either chain.

The broader 2026-07-21 registry audit live-probed every configured mainnet and
native testnet. Seventeen native testnets now opt into the default DeleGator
only because their exact chain IDs appear in MetaMask's v1.3 deployment map
and their configured RPC returned the expected bytecode plus a successful
plain ERC-7821 batch-mode probe. The same audit corrected Polygon's native POL
price ID, added MegaETH's CoinGecko platform ID, restored Unichain's installed
viem chain object, replaced Mode's dead mainnet explorer with its operator's
Blockscout URL, and replaced HyperEVM Testnet's unavailable explorer with the
live Hyperscan testnet explorer. Base Sepolia USDC token-paid gas is enabled
after fresh Pimlico discovery and quote verification; all other fee-token
catalog entries were re-quoted without address drift.

### Runtime Chain Resolution

Built-in chain metadata and user-customized chain state are intentionally split:

- `src/constants/chainRegistry.ts` defines the canonical built-in chains and all derived static maps. `MAINNET_CHAIN_REGISTRY` owns mainnet capabilities and mainnet-to-testnet identity mappings; `TESTNET_CHAIN_REGISTRY` promotes current public testnets into complete built-ins with a verified keyless RPC, explorer, native currency, parent identity, and `hiddenByDefault: true`. Legacy/deprecated testnet IDs stay only in a mainnet's `testnetChainIds` array for icon recognition. Existing custom-added testnets are normalized to the native entry by chain ID while preserving the user's selected RPC and visibility.
- `chrome.storage.sync.networksInfo` stores runtime overrides only: the active `rpcUrl`, hidden flags, and user-added custom chains. Every runtime RPC consumer continues to resolve only `rpcUrl`. Built-in-chain RPC selection/add/edit/remove actions autosave through the validated `updateNetwork` route, while custom-chain name, chain ID, endpoint, explorer, and currency changes remain staged until Save changes. Changing a custom chain ID re-keys its `networkRpcUrls` history in the service-worker mutation so saved endpoints remain attached to that network. `network/dappNetworkApproval.ts` owns confirmed EIP-3085 writes: a request for an existing hidden chain promotes the approved RPC, preserves prior endpoints, clears the hidden flag, and retains WalletChan's canonical identity/capability metadata under the network lock.
- `chrome.storage.local.networkRpcUrls` stores the optional Settings-only endpoint history as a decimal-chain-ID keyed record of `{ url, name?, allowImpersonatedTransactions? }` objects. Each list is deduplicated by URL and limited to ten endpoints; names are display-only and bounded to 64 characters. The boolean developer flag is opt-in and belongs to that exact endpoint, not the chain. The repository still decodes the released `string[]` shape, so metadata is upgraded lazily on the next successful save. Keeping this auxiliary data local avoids expanding the quota-constrained synced `networksInfo` item.
- `src/lib/chains.ts` is the required merge layer for runtime code. It normalizes `networksInfo`, keeps built-in chains keyed by their registry name, and exposes helpers like `getVisibleChains`, `getResolvedChainById`, and `getStoredRpcUrl`
- `src/chrome/network/networkRepository.ts` owns the network-configuration repository; shared `chainName` context also has renderer/content-script readers and writers (see Chain State and Switching); `rpcHistoryRepository.ts` owns `networkRpcUrls`; and `networkMutations.ts` owns locked service-worker mutations and composes pure `customNetworkValidation.ts` and `networkPolicy.ts`. Every saved endpoint URL and optional name is validated before persistence. Missing history is the normal legacy shape and Edit Network resolves it as a one-item list containing the active `rpcUrl`, so no eager migration is required. Settings UI and dapp `wallet_addEthereumChain` confirmations call extension-only background messages (`addNetwork`, `updateNetwork`, `setNetworkHidden`, `deleteNetwork`, `confirmAddChain`) instead of writing a full popup snapshot back to storage.
- `src/chrome/network/rpcClient.ts` is the final configured-RPC egress boundary. Direct JSON-RPC calls and every viem HTTP transport are request/streamed-response/timeout/concurrency bounded; the viem adapter also pins the validated URL against request-hook retargeting. All paths reject redirects and omit ambient credentials/referrers. New public RPC writes require HTTPS, while existing synced public-HTTP entries remain readable for upgrade compatibility and local/private Settings RPCs may use HTTP. URL userinfo and non-HTTP(S) schemes fail closed even when malformed legacy sync state reaches a read path.
- Remote dapps cannot propose or proxy a private-network RPC unless the dapp is itself local: loopback dapps may use loopback RPCs, while LAN dapps are restricted to another port on the exact same hostname. Settings remains the explicit escape hatch for user-owned localhost/LAN RPC development and accepts local host-and-port shorthand such as `localhost:8545`, canonicalizing it to HTTP before probing and storage.
- Edit Network exposes `This RPC allows sending txs from impersonated accounts` inside each endpoint's Add/Edit form, and manual Add Network exposes the same developer option under Advanced details. Send and Swap remain visible for impersonator accounts and stage their normal review screens. Without the selected endpoint's opt-in, confirmation stays disabled/reject-only. When enabled, a pinned single transaction or each reviewed sequential built-in-swap leg uses the standard `eth_sendTransaction` object (`from`, optional `to`, `data`, `value`, and reviewed gas fields) without a signature. The same exact selected-endpoint opt-in admits the existing bounded read-only provider proxy methods against that private RPC so dapp gas estimation and other transaction preflight can complete; it does not expand the proxy method allowlist. The fork RPC must already unlock or impersonate that address (for example Anvil auto/manual impersonation or a Tenderly Virtual TestNet admin RPC). The background rechecks the pinned account, active RPC, exact endpoint flag, provider authorization when applicable, and reset/effect lease at the irreversible boundary; endpoint changes are serialized against submission. Signatures, ERC-5792/cross-dapp batches, fee-token gas, EIP-7702/ERC-7715 authority, and normal public-RPC impersonator sends remain blocked.
- Custom explorer navigation is normalized separately from RPC configuration. Dapp proposals require public HTTPS. Settings may additionally retain explicit loopback HTTP(S) for local development; unsafe legacy explorer values are ignored rather than rendered.
- `src/contexts/NetworksContext.tsx` is a read-through mirror: it initializes via `ensureNetworksInfo` and subscribes to `chrome.storage.onChanged` for `networksInfo`, so long-lived sidepanels pick up chains added by other extension flows.
- Registry entries may set `hiddenByDefault: true`. The default is applied only when that built-in chain has no stored `networksInfo` entry, so newly introduced chains do not trigger homepage balance RPC calls until enabled, while an existing user visibility choice remains authoritative. Blast, Mantle, Mode, Scroll, Sonic, and every native testnet currently use this default. Settings → Chains presents separate Active and Hidden tabs; showing a testnet makes it available to local signers, Ledger, impersonator flows, provider switching, and other visible-chain consumers without a custom-chain form.

**Important:** Do not read `CHAIN_REGISTRY` and `networksInfo` separately in components/handlers to rebuild chain lists or look up RPC/explorer/native currency data. That is what caused custom-chain support to drift across screens. New runtime chain logic should go through `src/lib/chains.ts`, and new network mutations should stay inside `src/chrome/network/` and use the shared repository/lock so stale popup snapshots cannot delete chains added by the background.

**Default Network**: Base is set as the default network for new installations.

### Custom Chain UX Rules

- `wallet_addEthereumChain` requests for missing or hidden chains open the same Add Chain form used in Settings, prefilled with the dapp-provided values. Requests for an already-visible chain retain the silent success path.
- The user can edit the proposed chain name, RPC, explorer, and native currency fields before saving
- Chain deduplication is by `chainId`, not by dapp-provided name. Approving an existing hidden chain unhides its canonical entry, makes the approved dapp RPC active, and keeps the prior active/saved RPCs selectable in Settings without replacing built-in metadata.
- Dapp-initiated add-chain confirmation auto-switches the active wallet chain after the save succeeds. Settings-based add-chain does not auto-switch
- If the active chain is hidden or a custom active chain is deleted, the wallet immediately falls back to the first visible chain allowed for the current account type and shows a toast explaining the switch
- Do not allow a hide/delete action to leave the current account type with zero visible chains

### CoinGecko Resolution Service

Native asset price/logo resolution is centralized in the
`src/chrome/portfolio/` audit domain and exposed by
`src/chrome/portfolio/coingecko.ts`.

- All direct CoinGecko traffic goes through the background service worker
- `gasEstimation.ts` asks the service for built-in native token USD prices
- `portfolio/tokenCatalog.ts` sends a single batched background message for custom-chain native assets instead of hitting CoinGecko from the popup
- The service batches CoinGecko `coins/markets` requests across a short buffer window, caches market data in memory + `chrome.storage.local`, and caches search/resolution results for unknown custom assets
- ERC-20 batch price resolution tries GeckoTerminal's batched endpoint first, then falls back to CoinGecko one contract address at a time because CoinGecko's public `/simple/token_price/{platform}` endpoint rejects multi-address requests
- On CoinGecko `429`, the service falls back to cached/stale data and backs off briefly instead of hammering the API
- `coingeckoState.ts` owns the shared native/ERC-20 cache and backoff state;
  `coingeckoNative.ts`, `coingeckoErc20.ts`, and `directTokenPricing.ts` own
  bounded provider effects. The public facade contains no storage or network
  policy.
- Persistent metadata/image cache writes are best-effort. The stable
  `src/chrome/storageCachePruner.ts` facade delegates to
  `storage/cachePolicy.ts` and `storage/cachePruner.ts`, which run on
  service-worker startup and every 6 hours to delete expired non-critical
  entries so cache bloat cannot block vault/account/pending-request writes.
- `portfolioHoldingsCache` is also pruned there; it stores only public Holdings display snapshots for faster popup/sidepanel first paint and is safe to drop at any time.

ERC-20 display metadata is centralized behind the stable
`src/chrome/tokenMetadata.ts` facade and implemented in
`src/chrome/tokens/tokenMetadata.ts`.

- Resolves name/symbol/decimals via `fetchTokenInfo`
- Resolves logos through the swap token list, Bungee token list, watched-asset
  custom tokens, `tokens/tokenLogoConstants.ts`, then the WalletChan API's
  verified deterministic token-icon fallback
- Portfolio catalog calls skip the Bungee token-list fallback so holdings render from the portfolio API/RPC without waiting on bridge token metadata
- Used by receipt asset-change extraction, tx details backfill, clear-signed snapshots, batch call summaries, approve cards, and portfolio auto-add stubs so custom swap/bridge chains do not diverge by page
- Logo image bytes are warmed through the shared `ensAvatarImageCache` sanitizer as soon as a metadata lookup finds a URL. Renderer pages read only the reset-aware `chrome.storage.local` cache through `src/lib/avatarCacheClient.ts`; legacy DOM-localStorage mirrors are purged and never rehydrated.

The remaining released token utilities share the `chrome/tokens/` audit
domain while retaining their root import paths as export-only facades.
`customTokenStorage.ts` alone owns the unchanged `customTokens` array and
`local:customTokens` lock. NFT URI parsing/field/raster policy is pure in
`nftMetadataPolicy.ts`; `nftMetadata.ts` alone owns the public-HTTPS fetch,
manual redirect revalidation, five-second deadline, and 256 KiB body cap.
Unknown calldata scanning remains capped at 64 unique ABI-padded addresses.
One Multicall3 preflight keeps contracts whose `balanceOf(address)` succeeds or
whose ERC-165 response identifies ERC-1155, caches only complete ERC-20
name/symbol/decimals for ten minutes, and deliberately returns the original
bounded candidates when Multicall3 is unavailable.

### Per-Account-Type Chain Restrictions

Not all chains are supported by all account types. The Bankr API only supports a subset of built-in chains (currently Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, BNB Chain, Polygon, Robinhood Chain, and Unichain — see `isBankrSupported: true` in `chainRegistry.ts`). The remaining built-ins are available for PK, Seed Phrase, Ledger, and Impersonator accounts. PK / Seed / Ledger / Impersonator accounts can additionally add arbitrary custom EVM chains via Settings → Chains; Bankr accounts cannot use custom chains. Ledger still applies the execution exclusions documented above.

**Constants** (derived from `src/constants/chainRegistry.ts`, re-exported via `src/constants/networks.ts`):

| Constant                    | Purpose                                                        |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ALLOWED_CHAIN_IDS`         | All supported chain IDs (superset, used for global validation) |
| `BANKR_SUPPORTED_CHAIN_IDS` | Chain IDs supported by Bankr API accounts only                 |
| `OP_STACK_CHAIN_IDS`        | OP Stack L2 chains (for L1 fee breakdown in gas display)       |

**Enforcement points:**

1. **UI dropdown** (`App.tsx`): Chain dropdown filters by `activeAccount.type` — Bankr accounts only see `BANKR_SUPPORTED_CHAIN_IDS` chains
2. **Account switch** (`App.tsx`): When switching to a Bankr account, if current chain isn't supported, auto-switches to first supported chain
3. **Background validation** (`transactions/bankrConfirmation.ts`): `handleConfirmTransactionAsync` (Bankr path) rejects chains not in `BANKR_SUPPORTED_CHAIN_IDS`
4. **Inpage validation** (`impersonator.ts`): Validates against `ALLOWED_CHAIN_IDS` (imports from constants, no longer hardcoded)

**When adding a new built-in chain:** Add its mainnet entry to `MAINNET_CHAIN_REGISTRY` in `src/constants/chainRegistry.ts`, then add each current public testnet to `NATIVE_TESTNET_SPECS`. All derived maps and runtime resolvers auto-populate. See [ADD_CHAIN.md](./ADD_CHAIN.md) for the full checklist.

**When adding runtime chain behavior:** Extend `src/lib/chains.ts` instead of duplicating another `networksInfo` merge in a component or background handler.

## Provider Discovery (EIP-6963)

WalletChan implements [EIP-6963](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963) for multi-wallet discovery, allowing dapps to detect and display the wallet alongside other installed wallets.

### How It Works

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Provider Info

The wallet announces itself with the following EIP-6963 provider info:

| Property | Value                                      |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| uuid     | Random UUIDv4 (generated per page session) |
| name     | "Bankr Wallet"                             |
| icon     | Data URI of wallet icon (128x128 PNG)      |
| rdns     | "com.walletchan"                           |

### Implementation Details

Provider state and discovery live under `src/chrome/provider/inpage/`:
`announcement.ts` owns the frozen provider info, legacy claim, and EIP-6963
listener; `resultRouter.ts` announces after correlated initialization.
`impersonator.ts` is only the Vite entrypoint. The wallet announces on init and
re-announces on `eip6963:requestProvider` events.

### Backward Compatibility

The wallet maintains backward compatibility by:

1. Setting `window.ethereum` for legacy dapps
2. Announcing via EIP-6963 for modern dapps

Dapps that support EIP-6963 will show Bankr Wallet in their wallet selection UI. Legacy dapps will still work via `window.ethereum`.

### Multi-Wallet Conflict Handling

Some injected providers aggressively claim `window.ethereum` using
`Object.defineProperty` with a getter-only descriptor, which prevents another
provider from setting it via direct assignment. WalletChan handles this
gracefully:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                      window.ethereum Claim Strategy                          │
│                                                                             │
│  1. Try to delete existing window.ethereum property                         │
│     (clears getter-only descriptors if configurable)                        │
│                                                                             │
│  2. Try direct assignment: window.ethereum = provider                       │
│     (works if property doesn't exist or has a setter)                       │
│                                                                             │
│  3. If direct assignment fails, use Object.defineProperty with:             │
│     - configurable: true                                                    │
│     - writable: true                                                        │
│     - enumerable: true                                                      │
│                                                                             │
│  4. If all attempts fail:                                                   │
│     - Log a warning (not an error)                                          │
│     - Continue with EIP-6963 announcements                                  │
│     - Modern dapps will still discover the wallet                           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**See**: `src/chrome/provider/inpage/announcement.ts` →
`setWindowEthereum()` for the full claim strategy implementation.

**Internal Provider References**:

To avoid issues with other wallets intercepting `window.ethereum`, all internal operations use the `providerInstance` variable directly:

- `setAddress` and `setChainId` message handlers use `providerInstance`
- `wallet_switchEthereumChain` captures `this` reference before async operations
- EIP-6963 announcements use `providerInstance`

This ensures the wallet functions correctly even when `window.ethereum` is claimed by another extension.

Some legacy multi-wallet routers discover providers through EIP-6963 and then
relay `window.ethereum` through their own JavaScript `Proxy`. Such routers may
invoke provider methods or access getters with the router proxy as the receiver
instead of the announced provider instance. WalletChan's public `request`,
legacy `send`, internal RPC callback, and getter-only `selectedAddress`
projection are receiver-independent. The origin-authorized address remains a
native private field; proxy compatibility does not expose the active-wallet
fallback or weaken the connected-origin account boundary.

## Onboarding Flow

When the extension is first installed or reset, users are guided through a step-by-step onboarding wizard in a full-page browser tab.

### Auto-Open on Install

The background service worker listens for the `onInstalled` event:

```typescript
chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(async (details) => {
  if (details.reason === "install") {
    const onboardingUrl = chrome.runtime.getURL("onboarding.html");
    await chrome.tabs.create({ url: onboardingUrl });
  }
});
```

### Onboarding Steps

The onboarding flow varies based on account type selection:

**Step 1: Account Type Selection**

- Choose one initial account in this order: Seed Phrase, Private Key,
  View-only, or Bankr API
- Additional account types can be added later from Settings
- The full-page layout keeps Choose account, Add details, and Secure wallet
  visible in a persistent desktop progress rail

**Step 2a: Bankr Setup** (if Bankr or both selected)

- API key input field
- Wallet address input (supports ENS, Basename, WNS `.wei`, GNS `.gwei`, and MegaNames `.mega` resolution)
- Display name (optional) - allows custom naming like "My Bankr Wallet"
- Links to bankr.bot for API key and terminal

**Step 2b: Private Key Setup** (if PK selected)

- Uses shared `PrivateKeyInput` component (import existing or generate new)
- Auto-derives and displays address
- Display name (optional) - allows custom naming like "My Trading Wallet"
- Security warning about local storage

**Step 2c: Seed Phrase Setup** (if Seed Phrase selected)

- Uses `SeedPhraseSetup` component (import existing or generate new 12-word mnemonic)
- Display name (optional) for the first derived account

**Step 2d: View-only Setup** (if View-only selected)

- Address or supported name input (view-only, no signing key stored)
- Display name (optional)
- The same master-password vault is initialized with the non-Bankr sentinel so
  the account-management authorization model remains consistent

**Step 3: Create Password**

- Password + Confirm password fields (shared 8-character minimum,
  256-character maximum, and common-password rejection policy)
- Security warning about password recovery

**Step 4: Success**

- Animated green checkmark
- "You're all set!" message
- Floating arrow pointing to extension area
- "Pin & click the extension" instruction

### Tab Auto-Close

When the user opens the extension popup after completing onboarding, the onboarding tab is automatically closed:

```typescript
// In App.tsx init()
const onboardingUrlPattern = chrome.runtime.getURL("onboarding.html") + "*";
const onboardingTabs = await chrome.tabs.query({ url: onboardingUrlPattern });
for (const tab of onboardingTabs) {
  if (tab.id) {
    chrome.tabs.remove(tab.id).catch(() => {});
  }
}
```

**Note**: This requires the `tabs` permission in manifest.json to query and close `chrome-extension://` URLs.

### Already Configured Check

`getOnboardingInitializationStatus` asks the service worker to verify a
structurally complete wallet: at least one account, a valid credential/master
wrapper shape, and every private/seed account backed by the required encrypted
key/group records. It does not infer completion from one ciphertext key. A
complete wallet goes directly to success without exposing account secrets.

### Transactional Fresh-Wallet Initialization

The policy-free `onboardingInitialization.ts` facade exposes the focused
`onboarding/state.ts`, `onboarding/lifecycle.ts`, and
`onboarding/credential.ts` boundaries. Together they prevent crashes, reloads,
or two onboarding tabs from leaving an invisible generated key/phrase or a
half-configured wallet:

1. `beginOnboardingInitialization` distinguishes authoritative wallet state
   (credentials, key wrappers, passkey records, PK/mnemonic/privacy vaults,
   accounts, and seed groups) from disposable pre-marker residue. Any unmarked
   authoritative state fails closed and requires explicit recovery/reset; it is
   never deleted as presumed setup debris. If no authoritative state exists,
   old dapp permissions, pending/result routes, wallet-scoped caches, session
   recovery, and synced account mirrors are cleared before the non-secret
   `{ version: 1, id, startedAt }` marker is written. Unrelated preferences are
   preserved, so ENS/avatar cache writes from the seed-address preview cannot
   strand a genuinely fresh setup.
2. The initial general vault-key wrapper and encrypted credential commit in one
   `chrome.storage.local.set()`. Subsequent account/seed mutations must still
   own the same initialization ID.
3. Generated private keys and mnemonics are staged in renderer memory and shown
   for backup before persistence. The background save routes have no hidden
   generation fallback.
4. Completion removes the marker only after the full wallet is structurally
   complete. If that housekeeping removal fails, later status checks recognize
   the complete wallet and remove only the marker—they never roll keys back.
5. Before the marker is written, WalletConnect sessions/pairings are torn down
   and its SDK storage namespace is rotated. Failure to persist that cutover
   aborts setup before any new credential exists, so an older wallet's peer
   sessions cannot attach to the replacement wallet.
6. The owning surface may roll back its incomplete transaction; another live
   onboarding surface is blocked. An abandoned marker becomes recoverable after
   15 minutes. Rollback, completion, manual lock, and secret/account mutations
   share the wallet-secret operation serializer so stale work cannot resurrect
   removed state.

The v0.x single-account migration lives in `accounts/legacyMigration.ts`. Both
the `onInstalled` path and the renderer safety-net serialize through the wallet
secret-operation lock and re-read storage inside it, so overlapping invocations
cannot commit different account IDs. `getActiveAccount()` also repairs a stale
or missing `activeAccountId` left by older builds by selecting the first intact account;
valid Bankr, private-key, seed, and view-only selections are never changed. A malformed
legacy sync address fails closed without creating an unusable account row or
deleting the encrypted credential.

### Build Configuration

The onboarding page has its own Vite build config:

| Target     | Config File               | Output                        |
| ---------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Onboarding | vite.config.onboarding.ts | build/static/js/onboarding.js |

Build command: `pnpm build:onboarding` (included in `pnpm build`)

## dapp3 ENS Browser

WalletChan includes the dapp3 ENS browsing resolver inside the extension. The
More screen exposes `dapp3 Browser`, which opens the standalone extension page
`browse.html` in a browser tab. That page is a WalletChan-branded search-bar
launcher accepting a normal `https://` URL, `.eth` name, `.gwei` name, or raw
`0x` contract address, with optional path/query/hash suffixes. It is
intentionally not rendered inside the popup. Ordinary HTTPS URLs navigate
directly; credentials, HTTP URLs, malformed URLs, and inputs over 2,048
characters fail closed.

The launcher intentionally reuses the same resolver path as address-bar
browsing:

1. `pages/Dapp3Browser.tsx` parses input using the dapp3 launcher rules:
   - `name.eth[/path]` -> `http://name.eth[/path]`
   - `name.gwei[/path]` -> `http://name.gwei[/path]`
   - `0x<address>[/path]` -> `https://0x<address>.w3eth.io[/path]`
   - pasted `*.eth.limo`, `*.eth.link`, `*.gwei.domains`, `*.w3eth.io`, and
     `0x<address>.1.w3link.io` gateway URLs are normalized back to the
     underlying ENS/GNS/address target.
   - other valid `https://` URLs navigate directly without entering the
     resolver/interstitial path.
2. Resolver-backed inputs navigate the current browser tab to
   `interstitial.html#<target-url>`.
3. `EnsInterstitial` parses the fragment and sends `ens-cache-check` followed
   by `ens-resolve` to the service worker.
4. `ensBrowsing/resolver.ts` is the stable resolver facade.
   `resolverSupport.ts` owns the bounded direct RPC client and Ethereum mainnet
   Universal Resolver `resolveWithGateways` call. `nameResolvers.ts` resolves
   ENS `contenthash` records so CCIP-Read / ENSv2-backed names such as
   `.base.eth` can expose IPFS/IPNS content. If no supported contenthash is
   present, it falls back to viem `getEnsAddress` (same Universal Resolver
   path), while `erc4804Resolver.ts` probes, fetches, pins, and caches ERC-4804
   / ERC-5219 onchain HTML via the resolved address. `.gwei` names resolve
   through the GNS NameNFT resolver contract on Ethereum mainnet by reading
   `contenthash(namehash(name.gwei))` directly; `.gwei` supports IPFS/IPNS
   contenthashes first, then an explicit `contentcontract` text record.
   `gweiContract.ts` accepts bare/mainnet (`eth:`) and Sepolia (`sep:`)
   addresses; it never falls back to the name owner or payment address.
   Hosted navigation retains `name.gwei.domains`. With local HTML pinning
   enabled, the configured RPC for the content chain reads root HTML using
   ERC-5219 `request([],[])` or manual raw `/` calldata. Local snapshots reject
   non-200, encoded, chunked, non-HTML, empty, and over-1-MiB responses.
   Full path-dependent sites remain available through the hosted gateway.
5. The service worker chooses either the hosted gateway (`eth.limo`,
   `gwei.domains`, or `w3eth.io`) or the configured local Kubo gateway based on
   the existing `ensBrowsing` settings. Raw `0x` address mode follows the same split:
   `pinOnchainHtml` OFF probes support and routes to hosted `w3eth.io`;
   `pinOnchainHtml` ON fetches and pins the HTML body to local Kubo.
   Local Kubo API calls use a 10-second abort and a 64 KiB streaming response
   cap, so a non-Kubo or malicious localhost service cannot pin the service
   worker indefinitely or feed an unbounded control response.
   Navigations to w3link's mainnet pattern (`0x<address>.1.w3link.io`) are
   also redirected to the interstitial and normalized into this raw-address
   path when ENS browsing is enabled.
6. Local Kubo pages load `static/js/ens-banner.js`. Its source entrypoint,
   `chrome/ensBanner.ts`, only initializes `ensBrowsing/banner/controller.ts`.
   The banner's restricted input grammar and page metadata live in
   `pageState.ts`; exact runtime requests in `transport.ts`; bookmark and
   hosted-gateway behavior in dedicated action modules; and closed-shadow DOM,
   styling, and SPA synchronization in view/controller modules. The content
   script still performs no name resolution, remote fetch, DNR mutation, or
   script evaluation. Hosted gateway navigation continues through
   `ens-open-on-gateway` so the authorized service-worker path installs the
   per-tab bypass before navigation.

WNS browsing additionally accepts bare `.wei` names and exact
`*.wei.limo` / `*.wei.domains` URLs, preserving path, query, and fragment.
`weiResolver.ts` reads `contenthash(bytes32)` from the existing mainnet WNS
registry (`WEI_CONTRACT`). IPFS/IPNS records use the normal gateway path; an
empty record falls back to the registry's `addr(bytes32)` and the resolved
contract's `html()` function. Invalid/unsupported contenthashes and failed
registry reads fail closed. HTML reads use the bounded configured RPC and
require nonempty output of at most 1 MiB. With both local-gateway and HTML
pinning enabled, the existing onchain HTML cache/pinning boundary stores it
under an isolated Kubo CID origin; otherwise the hosted target is wei.limo.
Production Chromium background builds explicitly compact formatting with
Terser because Vite skips its minifier for ES library output. Compression and
name mangling remain disabled; function/class names and license comments are
retained. Development output remains readable, and the existing privacy
worker-boundary scan and 4 MiB background budget still run after formatting.
Gateway DNR construction is shared across families while retaining existing
rule IDs, priorities, patterns, and tab-scoped bypass behavior.
WNS gateway interception is enabled only for local-gateway routing and goes
directly to the interstitial. Hosted fallback installs a matching per-tab
ALLOW rule, also removed on tab close. WNS names retain their own namespace
in bookmarks, favicons, and banner gateway actions and never use ENS history.

Hosted-gateway redirect rules are deliberately conditional. The base `.eth` /
`.gwei` and w3link rules are installed whenever ENS browsing is enabled. The
`*.eth.limo` / `*.eth.link` and `*.gwei.domains` rewrites are installed only
when `useLocalGateway` is ON, because WalletChan's hosted fallback already
targets eth.limo or gwei.domains and rewriting that target back to `.eth` /
`.gwei` creates an interstitial reload loop. Before the resolver, cache
fast-path, or content-refresh flow intentionally navigates a tab to eth.limo,
gwei.domains, or w3eth.io, the service worker installs the matching per-tab DNR
ALLOW bypass. That bypass protects tabs from WalletChan's old Dapp3-style
gateway rewrite state after WalletChan has chosen a hosted gateway.

The launcher lists user-pinned `ensBookmarks` entries as "Favorite dapps"
first, ordinary injected sites from `dappPermissions` as "Connected dapps"
second, then the freshest valid `ensResolveCache` entries as "Recently cached
dapps". Favorite cards expose a drag grip that supports mouse, touch, and
keyboard grid reordering. The resulting zero-based `sortOrder` is stored on the
existing non-secret bookmark records; legacy entries remain newest-first and a
new unranked favorite appears before an established custom order. The existing
`ensBookmarks` storage listener keeps open launcher tabs synchronized. The
resolver input also filters connected sites by hostname, title, or
origin while the user types. Connected results use a three-row scroll region so
larger permission sets do not push the rest of the launcher out of view.
`browse.html` obtains the permission list only through the narrow
`ens-list-connected-dapps` route: `ensBrowsing/senderAuthorization.ts` requires
the exact top-level launcher, and `connectedDapps.ts` returns at most 24
origin-derived hostnames with bounded title, sanitized favicon, and last-used
time. It never returns account addresses or arbitrary permission fields.
Connected-site tiles open canonical HTTPS origins in a new active tab through
the same exact-launcher route used by directory results; legacy HTTP origins
retain same-page navigation. Their
hover/focus actions can create a non-secret favorite or disconnect the exact
origin through `ens-revoke-connected-dapp`. That mutation is also restricted to
the exact top-level launcher and delegates to the same complete revocation
lifecycle as More → Connected dapps, including pending-request cancellation,
tab account cleanup, page notification, and permission-change broadcast.
Favoriting adds a normalized HTTP(S) `launchUrl` to the existing bookmark
record; permission revocation never deletes that bookmark, so it remains until
the user explicitly removes it from Favorite dapps.
ENS/GNS/onchain tile clicks still submit the name/address back through the same
interstitial path rather than constructing gateway URLs in the page. Gateway
visits can attach optional title/favicon metadata to the cache. Favorite cards
replace the generic saved-state caption with the normalized hostname or
resolver name/path. Local IPFS/IPNS favicon paths are remapped onto the matching
public eth.limo, gwei.domains, or w3eth.io gateway before crossing the raster
cache. When Chrome has already rendered the exact local gateway page's favicon,
the banner stores Chrome's `/_favicon/` projection for that page instead. The
launcher accepts the same processed projection for exact `*.eth.limo`,
`*.eth.link`, `*.gwei.domains`, and `*.w3eth.io` hosted gateway pages. This
allows inline SVG favicons to appear without assigning SVG metadata to the
extension DOM. Missing icons fall back to the hosted gateway `/favicon.ico` and
then a letter tile. Raw `0x` ERC-4804 address-mode resolutions are cached here too so
onchain HTML dapps opened without ENS still appear in the recent tiles.

The same input also performs a 250 ms debounced directory lookup using the
DefiLlama endpoint already used by the website OS page. Only the exact
top-level `browse.html` page can send `ens-search-dapp-directory`. The service
worker normalizes the query to 120 characters, posts it to the exact
`https://search-core.defillama.com/multi-search` endpoint with a 5-second
deadline and 64 KiB response cap, and returns no more than eight bounded
name/HTTPS-route/sanitized-logo records. The key is the public DefiLlama search
client key: the background build accepts `VITE_DEFILLAMA_SEARCH_KEY` or
`NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFILLAMA_SEARCH_KEY` and otherwise reuses the website OS
`NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFILLAMA_SEARCH_KEY`; it is not delivered to the browser-page
renderer. Arrow keys cycle suggestions, Escape dismisses them, and Enter opens
the active result (or the first directory match for free-text searches).
Suggestion activation sends `ens-open-dapp-url`; the exact top-level launcher
is retained while the bounded credential-free HTTPS result opens in a new
active tab. Each suggestion exposes an independent hover/focus star action.
That action stores or removes an origin-normalized ordinary-dapp bookmark and
does not open the suggestion; the existing bookmark storage listener promotes
it into Favorite dapps immediately.
Suggestion and tile logos then use `ens-cache-browser-image`, an exact
top-level-`browse.html` route into the shared avatar raster cache. The page
shows only the decoded/re-encoded data URL written by that cache and never
assigns the DefiLlama or favicon URL directly to an image element.

Bookmark/cache storage listeners plus connected-permission runtime, storage,
focus, and visibility reconciliation keep an open launcher current without a
manual reload.

The launcher keeps a bookmark-page reminder fixed to the viewport's upper-right
corner and shows the platform-native bookmark shortcut. Dismissing it writes
only the non-secret
`walletchan:browseBookmarkReminderDismissed:v1` DOM-localStorage flag; it does
not request Chrome's broad bookmarks permission or invoke a privileged route.

Renderer dapp identity uses the shared display-only
`lib/dappOriginDisplay.ts` projection and `useDappOriginDisplay.ts` storage
adapter. When an exact HTTP origin matches the user's configured Kubo
subdomain gateway host **and port**, the projection matches its IPFS/IPNS label
against retained `ensResolveCache` metadata and displays the original `.eth`,
`.gwei`, or raw `0x` ERC-4804 identity. The storage adapter keeps browser
cards, connection and signing prompts, pending requests, delegated permissions,
activity, and transaction details synchronized after cache or gateway-setting
changes. Resolver records older than the one-hour navigation TTL may be used
for this label only; they are never restored to the navigation cache path.
Exact `*.eth.limo` and `*.eth.link` hosts are also projected back to their
underlying `.eth` identity. That hosted match, or a cached local IPFS/IPNS
match, is the sole renderer eligibility signal for the connection prompt's
contenthash-history lookup; ordinary sites, lookalike suffixes, `.gwei`, and
ERC-4804 address-mode pages do not trigger it.
The same projection supplies favicon sources across those surfaces: a safe
cached raster or processed Chrome favicon first, a local asset path projected
onto the matching public eth.limo/gwei.domains/w3eth.io gateway next, Chrome's
fixed-size `/_favicon/` endpoint for the exact local page as fallback, and then
the public favicon service or letter tile. Inline SVG page favicons remain
excluded from renderer image sources. `DappSiteIcon`, `RequestIdentity`, batch
call identities, pending requests, activity, and watch-asset prompts all
consume this shared order rather than resolving local dapp icons independently.
The underlying origin remains unchanged everywhere authorization, SIWE checks,
permission revocation, history persistence, or tab navigation depends on it.

On local-gateway pages, the injected WalletChan · Browser banner links its left
logo/title cluster to `browse.html` in the same tab. The right side includes a
star button that writes/removes a local `ensBookmarks` entry for the current
ENS/GNS/address identity and path. Bookmarks store only non-secret display
metadata such as title and favicon; connected-site favorites may additionally
store their normalized HTTP(S) origin.

No wallet credentials are used by this flow. It reads the bounded public
display projection of exact-origin dapp grants, reads Ethereum mainnet via the
configured RPC, and optionally writes non-secret ENS / ERC-4804 caches and
bookmarks.

## Transaction Flow

### 1. Dapp Discovers & Connects to Wallet

Modern dapps (EIP-6963):

```javascript
// Dapp listens for wallet announcements
window.addEventListener("eip6963:announceProvider", (event) => {
  const { info, provider } = event.detail;
  // info.name === "Bankr Wallet"
  // provider is the EIP-1193 provider
});

// Dapp requests wallets to announce
window.dispatchEvent(new Event("eip6963:requestProvider"));
```

Legacy dapps:

```javascript
// Direct access to injected provider
const provider = window.ethereum;
```

### 2. Dapp Initiates Transaction

```javascript
// Dapp calls (works with both EIP-6963 provider or window.ethereum)
await provider.request({
  method: "eth_sendTransaction",
  params: [
    {
      to: "0x...", // null for contract deployment
      data: "0x...",
      value: "0x0",
      // Optional gas params (forwarded through full pipeline if present):
      // gas, gasPrice, maxFeePerGas, maxPriorityFeePerGas
    },
  ],
});
```

**Contract Deployment**: When the `to` field is `null` (not address zero), the transaction is treated as a contract deployment. This is supported across both Bankr API and Private Key accounts. The confirmation UI shows a "Contract Deployment" badge instead of a recipient address.

**Gas Parameters**: Dapp-provided gas fields (`gas`, `gasPrice`, `maxFeePerGas`, `maxPriorityFeePerGas`) are forwarded through the full pipeline (impersonator → inject → background → pending storage). These are used as defaults in gas estimation and sent to the Bankr API or local signer.

### 3. Impersonator Validates & Forwards

`src/chrome/provider/inpage/transactionAdapter.ts`:

- Validates chain ID is in allowed list (1, 137, 8453, 130)
- Creates unique transaction ID
- Allows `to` to be null for contract deployment transactions
- Forwards dapp-provided gas parameters (`gas`, `gasPrice`, `maxFeePerGas`, `maxPriorityFeePerGas`) if present
- Posts message to content script
- Returns Promise that resolves when tx completes

### 4. Content Script Bridges to Background

`src/chrome/provider/contentBridge/signingRoutes.ts`:

- Receives `i_sendTransaction` message
- Generates a unique `txId` (UUID) in the content script
- Immediately starts watching `chrome.storage.onChanged` for a `txResult:{txId}` key (via `waitForStorageResult`)
- Sends a **fire-and-forget** `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` to background (no callback) with the `txId` included
- When the storage result appears, forwards it back to inpage via `postMessage`
- Installs no age-based timeout. The listener remains active until the user or
  an explicit authorization/session/account/reset lifecycle resolves the
  request and publishes its durable terminal result.
- **Security**: Only forwards whitelisted message types from background to the webpage (`setAddress`, `setChainId`, `setAccount`). All other background broadcasts are not forwarded, preventing dapps from eavesdropping on wallet events.

> **Why no sendMessage callback?** Chrome MV3 swallows `sendResponse` calls when multiple `onMessage` listeners exist across extension contexts (background + popup/sidepanel). The storage-based approach is immune to this because it bypasses the message channel entirely.

### 5. Background Stores Pending Transaction & Opens the Request Surface

`src/chrome/background.ts`:

- Uses the `txId` provided in the message (generated by content script)
- Validates and normalizes `tx.value` through `src/chrome/transactionValidation.ts`; malformed values write a `txResult:{txId}` error and are not stored as pending requests
- Stores pending transaction in `chrome.storage.local`
- Updates extension badge with pending count
- Opens the configured confirmation surface for user confirmation. On browsers
  with side-panel support, missing `sidePanelMode` defaults to enabled; an
  explicit `false` preserves popup mode. When enabled, the content bridge sends
  `openProviderRequestSidePanel` synchronously from the original user gesture
  for dapp connection prompts, single transactions, ERC-5792 batches, signatures, and
  `wallet_requestExecutionPermissions`. Before sending that presentation-only
  signal, `contentBridge/requestSurfacePreflight.ts` synchronously reuses the
  bounded provider envelope validation plus the content-script-attested active
  chain, connected-origin state, account address, and account type. Connection
  preflight requires an unconnected `eth_requestAccounts` call with a valid
  active account; `eth_accounts` remains non-interactive. Invalid
  payloads, disconnected origins, stale/wrong-chain requests, unsupported
  batch versions, ineligible ERC-7715 account types, and signer/`from`
  mismatches therefore return through the normal provider error. Signature
  preflight also runs the complete bounded EIP-712 schema/raw-delegation policy
  and requires a finite typed-data `domain.chainId` to match the request's
  active chain, mirroring every synchronous signature rejection before storage.
  Batch preflight mirrors wallet-type/chain support, caller binding, and unsafe
  self-recursion policy. ERC-7715 preflight mirrors request count, account type,
  supported delegate chain, address binding, permission data, and rule policy
  before its network-backed delegation eligibility checks.
  These failures return without opening a sidepanel or recording a loading
  hint. The background
  repeats all validation authoritatively before persistence. The early signal
  still runs before authorization or storage awaits can consume Chromium's
  transient user activation. This policy is identical in normal and fullscreen
  browser windows. If a fullscreen
  side-panel open still fails after the gesture is consumed, WalletChan leaves
  the dapp in place and shows a native notification whose click retries the
  panel open with a fresh user gesture.
- The synchronous open also records a ten-second, window-scoped, one-shot
  request-family hint. A cold popup/sidepanel consumes it through the trusted-UI
  `getProviderRequestSurfaceHint` route before loading the five approval queues.
  If the hinted queue is not persisted yet, `app/initialApprovalRequests.ts`
  keeps the request-shaped skeleton visible and polls only that queue for up to
  five seconds. `app/lazyScreens.ts` simultaneously preloads the hinted review
  chunk. As soon as the matching durably pinned request and current lock state
  are available, `app/initialApprovalRoute.ts` selects that exact review family
  and releases the skeleton; homepage, WalletConnect, secondary request,
  account-list, and active-dapp hydration continue concurrently behind the
  visible review. ERC-5792 intake persists its pinned request with
  `intakeStatus: "validating"` before any network-backed atomic-delegate probe,
  so the actual batch review paints immediately. Confirm, edit, split, move,
  and reject-all controls remain unavailable until transport/capability
  validation, the bundle-status commit, and final authorization revalidation
  succeed and atomically remove that marker. The request's own Reject action
  remains available during gas estimation and provisional intake; removal wins
  safely if it races validation. Bankr and both local wallet paths
  also reject a validating record in the service worker, so renderer state can
  never make the provisional prompt actionable. Successful request persistence clears any hint the
  renderer did not already consume. The renderer therefore never paints Home
  between panel open and the transaction, batch, signature, or ERC-7715 review
  screen. The hint contains no request payload, origin, account, or
  authorization data and can never produce an actionable confirmation by
  itself.

### 6. Confirmation Surface Auto-Opens

The extension automatically opens the configured confirmation surface when a
single transaction, batch transaction, signature, or ERC-7715 permission
request is received:

- Popup positioned at **top-right of the dapp's browser window**
- Works correctly across **multiple monitors** (follows the dapp's window)
- Sidepanel mode opens the panel in both normal and fullscreen Chrome windows;
  explicit popup mode and unsupported browsers retain the popup path
- If popup already exists, focuses the existing window instead of creating a new one
- Shows the **newest transaction** by default (e.g., "2/2" not "1/2")

### 7. User Confirms Transaction in Popup

`src/App.tsx` + `src/components/TransactionConfirmation.tsx`:

- If wallet locked (API key not cached): shows unlock screen first
- Shows pending transaction banner if requests exist
- Displays: origin (with favicon), network, to address (with labels), value, data
- **Gas estimation** fetched on mount via `estimateGas` message to background (see Gas Estimation below)
- **Address nonce** appears as an editable decimal field in Advanced details for
  native-gas Private Key, Seed Phrase, and Ledger transactions. The initial
  value is a read-only preview of the pending RPC nonce plus WalletChan's
  rapid-send cache; opening the screen does not reserve it. Confirm sends the
  reviewed value to the matching local/Ledger execution path, which validates
  and reserves that exact nonce before signing. The signed nonce is persisted
  into transaction history so Transaction details can show it at the bottom of
  Advanced details after gas diagnostics. Bankr, impersonator,
  force-inclusion, and fee-token UserOperation paths neither show nor accept
  this transaction-nonce override.
- User clicks Confirm or Reject
- Closing popup does NOT cancel transaction (persisted)

#### Address Labels

The "to" address displays labels fetched from eth.sh API:

```typescript
const response = await fetch(
  `https://eth.sh/api/labels/${tx.to}?chainId=${tx.chainId}`,
);
const labels = await response.json();
// Displays as badges below the address (e.g., "Uniswap V3: Router")
```

#### Multiple Transaction Handling

When multiple transactions are pending:

- **Navigation**: Arrow buttons (`<` `>`) to switch between transactions
- **Counter**: Badge showing position (e.g., "2/2")
- **Reject All**: Button to reject all pending transactions at once
- **Header Layout**: Back arrow (left) | "Tx Request < 2/2 >" (center) | "Reject All" (right)

Each transaction maintains its own storage-based result channel (`txResult:{txId}`) — rejecting/confirming one transaction only affects that specific dapp's request.

### 7. Background Submits to Bankr API

`src/chrome/bankr/submission.ts`:

- POST to `https://api.bankr.bot/wallet/submit` with transaction object and `waitForConfirmation: true`
- Synchronous response — returns tx hash directly (no polling needed)
- Value converted from hex to decimal string (wei)
- Drops dapp-provided gas params on this path because Bankr manages gas server-side; gas overrides apply only to local-signing PK/Seed accounts

### 8. Result Returned to Dapp

- Transaction hash returned directly from `/wallet/submit` response
- Background writes result to `chrome.storage.local` under key `txResult:{txId}` (via `writeResultToStorage`)
- Content script's `chrome.storage.onChanged` listener picks up the result and forwards it to the inpage provider
- Dapp receives the tx hash from `eth_sendTransaction`
- Content script removes the `txResult:{txId}` key after reading

## WalletConnect Bridge

WalletConnect support is a parallel dapp transport for sites that do not list WalletChan through ERC-6963. It intentionally reuses the same pending request and confirmation machinery as the injected provider.

**UX flow:**

1. Popup → More → WalletConnect.
2. User pastes a `wc:` URI from the dapp.
3. Background `walletConnectPair` pairs through `@reown/walletkit`.
4. The service worker auto-approves the session for the current active signing account and visible chains.
5. Active sessions render on `WalletConnectView`. While any session exists, the home screen shows `WalletConnectBanner` below the pending-request banner.

**Background modules:**

- `walletConnect/client.ts` owns WalletKit initialization, generation-bound SDK listeners, relay recovery, and reset cutover. `sessionCommands.ts` exposes the four UI-only list/pair/disconnect/switch operations; `resultBridge.ts` delivers final `txResult:*`, `sigResult:*`, and `erc7715PermissionResult:*` values without creating another signing path.
- `walletConnect/proposal.ts` normalizes and bounds proposal metadata. `sessionProposal.ts` applies signing-account and visible-chain namespace policy before approval. Proposals with no approvable namespace are rejected and a sanitized `walletConnectProposalRejected` summary is broadcast for the UI.
- `walletConnect/requestRouter.ts` claims and validates every `session_request` before dispatch. `pendingRequests.ts` alone creates pinned transaction/signature confirmation records, keeping account binding and popup effects out of the method router. Duplicate in-flight requests receive `-32002`; stored terminal results replay exactly.
- `walletConnect/batchRequests.ts` adapts ERC-5792 methods to `batchTxHandlers.ts`; `rpcRequests.ts` owns chain mutation and allowlisted bounded read-only RPC forwarding.
- `walletConnect/protocol.ts` persists the first terminal JSON-RPC response before relay delivery. `outbox.ts` replays retained terminal responses and removes them only after successful delivery or confirmed session absence. `sessionPolicy.ts` owns CAIP/account/method rules and sanitized bounded peer metadata.
- `walletConnect/chainState.ts` maintains the WalletConnect-specific `walletConnectChainId`, separate from injected per-tab state, and emits supported `chainChanged` events.
- `walletConnect/keepalive.ts` sends the active-session relay fetch pulse while at least one session exists; it has no credential or wallet-secret dependency.
- `walletConnect/storage.ts` owns the bounded durable claim/route/terminal map and active WalletConnect chain key. Claim-to-route transfer is atomic and the first terminal response wins.
- `walletConnect/reset.ts` tears down sessions/pairings, purges the current SDK
  store best-effort, and commits a fresh `walletConnectStorageNamespace` before
  wallet reset removes secrets. Existing installs with no namespace continue
  to use WalletConnect's legacy unprefixed store until reset; a present
  malformed namespace fails closed rather than silently selecting that legacy
  identity.

**Environment:** WalletConnect uses `VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID` (or `VITE_WC_PROJECT_ID`) when provided, and otherwise falls back to WalletChan's default public WalletConnect project ID. Every extension-owned WalletConnect Core instance explicitly sets `telemetryEnabled: false`; relay traffic required for pairing and active sessions remains functional network activity.

**Supported request behavior:**

- `eth_sendTransaction` uses the same confirmation screens and Bankr/PK/Seed signing paths as injected dapp transactions.
- ERC-5792 batching is supported over WalletConnect through `wallet_getCapabilities`, `wallet_sendCalls`, `wallet_getCallsStatus`, and `wallet_showCallsStatus`. `wallet_sendCalls` responds with the bundle id only after the pending request and status are durably queued and the live session is revalidated; the response is persisted before relay delivery so a delivery retry returns the same bundle id without enqueueing a second batch. The dapp polls `wallet_getCallsStatus` just like the injected-provider route. Each inner call's native `value` is normalized through `transactionValidation.ts` before the batch is stored; malformed values return a `batchTxAck` error and older malformed pending batches are blocked in the confirmation UI.
- `personal_sign`, `eth_signTypedData_v3`, and `eth_signTypedData_v4` use the same signature confirmation screens. EIP-712 validation/sanitization is shared with the injected-provider path.
- `eth_sign` and deprecated `eth_signTypedData` v1 are rejected.
- `eth_accounts`, `eth_requestAccounts`, `eth_chainId`, `net_version`, `wallet_switchEthereumChain`, and a small read-only RPC allowlist are answered directly in the background.
- WalletConnect chain selection is shared across all WC sessions, not per browser tab. Injected dapps continue to use their existing per-tab content-script chain state.

**Security model:** WalletConnect is a transport only. Request account binding is still pinned at arrival (`accountId`, `accountAddress`, `accountType`), and confirm-time signing resolves the pinned account rather than the currently active account. Private-key, seed-phrase, Ledger, and Bankr accounts approve sessions through their normal confirmation/signing paths. Ledger advertises only single transactions and its supported personal/EIP-712 signatures; ERC-5792 and delegated-permission methods remain excluded. Verified Safe accounts advertise single transactions and ERC-5792 batching, which remain pending until Safe execution produces the result expected by the dapp; EOA-style message signing and delegated permissions are excluded. View-only impersonator accounts cannot approve sessions or sign requests.

### Swap API and token metadata

Swap eligibility follows the exact chain IDs checked in 0x's **Swap and
Gasless APIs** table. `chainRegistry.ts` derives `ZEROX_SUPPORTED_CHAIN_IDS`
from built-in `isSwapSupported` flags, while the website price and quote
proxies share `api/swap/supportedChains.ts`. The separate 0x Cross-Chain API
table is not evidence of single-chain Swap API support; accordingly, Blast and
Mode are built-in networks but are not swap-eligible.

`src/chrome/swapApi.ts` is an implementation-free compatibility facade over
the focused `chrome/swap/` domain. The split preserves its released exports,
query construction, error text, response ceilings, RPC fallbacks, storage keys,
TTLs, pinned-token precedence, and approval calldata. See
`chrome/swap/README.md` for ownership and effect flow.

Price and firm quote reads use the fixed WalletChan swap proxy through
`network/boundedHttp.ts`: GET only, redirects rejected, ambient credentials and
referrers omitted, a 15-second deadline, and a 2 MiB response ceiling. Token
catalog responses use the same deadline with a 2 MiB ceiling and a strict
2,000-entry runtime codec before cache or UI release; token-price responses use
10 seconds and 64 KiB. Invalid JSON and non-object top-level
responses retain distinct released errors, and remote error/reason strings are
truncated to 1,000 characters.

ERC-20 and Permit2 balance/allowance reads resolve only the extension's
configured chain RPC and use `network/rpcClient.ts` with an 8-second timeout and
no retries. A missing RPC or failed read retains the released zero fallback;
these helpers never sign or broadcast. Approval builders remain pure: standard
ERC-20 approval preserves the requested amount, while Permit2 clamps to
`uint160` and sets the released 30-day expiry.

Token metadata caches remain non-secret and behavior-compatible:
`tokenInfo:{chainId}:{lowercaseAddress}` and positive
`tokenLogo:{chainId}:{lowercaseAddress}` results use 30-day TTLs, while logo
misses use six hours and `swapTokenList:{chainId}` uses 24 hours. Pinned WalletChan
tokens merge at read time so canonical metadata wins without a cache migration.
Negative logo records carry a fallback version; older empty records created
before the deterministic external source are treated as stale immediately.
When the catalog has no ERC-20 logo, the extension asks the address-aware form
of `/api/swap/token-list`; the website verifies the deterministic external
token-icon PNG with a bounded HEAD request before returning its URL. This
fallback also feeds simulation rows, while NFT imagery stays on its separate
metadata path. Cache writes are best-effort; stale token lists remain the
offline fallback.

### Estimated permission changes

The transaction, ERC-5792 batch, cross-dapp batch, and Safe confirmation
surfaces include ERC-20/ERC-2612 and Permit2 permission increases in
`Estimated changes`. Permission rows render before Send/Receive deltas;
unlimited allowances use danger styling, and bounded or unverified grants use
warning styling. The projection is account-address based and runs before any
signing path, so Bankr, private-key, seed-phrase, Ledger, and reject-only
impersonator review surfaces share the same read-only behavior.
The same simulation also projects verified residual ERC-20 allowances for
tokens leaving the reviewed account. Those rows render after Send/Receive as a
separate `Approval remains` warning so an existing spend approval is not
mistaken for an asset delta.
One strict standalone ERC-20 `approve(address,uint256)` request, including
`approve(spender, 0)`, omits the whole `Estimated changes` section because its
editable approval card in Request details is the more complete single source
of review truth. `increaseAllowance`, legacy `increaseApproval`, permits, opaque nested approvals,
multicalls, batches, and Safe requests retain the simulation section because
they do not use that standalone editable approval presentation.

Permission discovery combines two bounded sources. Local decoding covers
direct ERC-20 `approve`/allowance mutations, ERC-2612 `permit`, Permit2
approve/permit/lockdown, self-delegatecall `multicall(bytes[])` contracts,
canonical Multicall3, ERC-7821 execution batches, and Safe MultiSend CALL
entries. Separately, the first `eth_simulateV1` execution
collects ERC-20 and canonical Permit2 approval events from successful calls,
which exposes approvals nested inside otherwise opaque protocol calldata.
Events identify candidate owner/token/spender pairs; they are not treated as
proof that an allowance remains.

For every candidate pair, `approvalSimulation.ts` reads allowance at the
pinned parent block and replays the exact reviewed call sequence at that same
block with final allowance reads appended. A verified ERC-20 row is emitted
only when the final allowance exceeds pre-state. A verified Permit2 row is
emitted only when the effective live amount increases or the same live amount
receives a later expiry. Consequently an approval fully spent, expired,
reduced, or revoked later in the same batch is omitted. If `eth_simulateV1`,
pre-state, final readback, or exact Safe envelope verification is unavailable,
a nonzero locally/event-discovered grant remains visible only as
`unverified`; the UI states that the remaining allowance could not be checked.
An exact outer Safe revert suppresses all permission rows, while an unavailable
outer pass downgrades underlying-call rows to unverified.

Residual-approval discovery is a separate late task and never delays the
primary asset-change response. Successful positive outgoing fungible ERC-20
`Transfer` logs retain the current per-call target fallback, and an exact
successful `Approval` event may identify another spender. When the configured
RPC supports `debug_traceCall` with `callTracer`, one state-overridden
sequential request trace also finds successful nested
`token.transferFrom(owner, recipient, amount)` frames: the token is the frame
target and the actual spender is its immediate EVM caller. Trace evidence wins
over an Approval event, which wins over the per-call target when the same pair
is found more than once. Incoming, zero-value, wrong-owner, delegatecall,
reverted, malformed, over-depth, and truncated trace candidates are ignored or
mark detection incomplete.

The late read path is rate-limit conscious. Trace and log discovery run
concurrently at one pinned block. A single isolated TxSimulator `eth_call`
reads all candidate allowances, executes the complete reviewed call sequence
with the simulator installed at the wallet or Safe address, then reads every
allowance again. A residual warning is released only when the request and both
allowance reads succeed and final `allowance(owner, spender)` is nonzero. This
retains unchanged unlimited allowances. Residual metadata uses one bounded
token enrichment pass and never resolves spender names.

Tracing uses only the selected configured RPC: at most one trace per request,
a five-second deadline, 2 MiB response ceiling, 512-frame and 32-level parser
bounds, no same-request retry, ten-minute supported/unsupported endpoint
caching, and a one-minute transient cooldown. Unsupported, busy, or failing
trace endpoints silently retain Approval-event and per-call target discovery.
No third-party simulator or WalletChan proxy is used.

When the background confirms that a residual row is actionable, the review UI
offers `Revoke?` with a hover/focus explanation of the appended batch call.
When two or more actionable rows remain, one centered `Revoke all` action
submits every displayed token/spender pair through the same request-family
mutation in one operation.
The late detector resolves the durable transaction, ERC-5792 bundle,
cross-dapp batch, or Safe proposal entirely in the background and returns only
short-lived opaque detection/evidence IDs alongside display rows. The
renderer sends those IDs back; it does not authorize token, spender, calldata,
or source-call selection. Before mutation, the background re-resolves the
pending request and requires the exact account/chain/call fingerprint to match
the in-memory five-minute evidence record. It then constructs canonical
`approve(spender, 0)` calldata from the bound evidence and appends it after the
dapp-authored calls.
Bulk cleanup validates and deduplicates the complete bounded list, verifies
capacity before writing, and performs one durable update so it cannot expose a
partially modified request. The resulting call-list change triggers one fresh
simulation; pairs whose final allowance is zero disappear while any remaining
nonzero pair stays actionable.
For an ERC-5792 request this mutates the still-pending bundle and marks atomic
execution required. For a staged user-assembled batch it appends a
wallet-generated entry. For a single transaction it durably stages the source
transaction and cleanup together before removing the original pending row,
converting review to the existing user-assembled atomic batch flow. The
generated entry inherits the original transaction or bundle authority group
but never receives its own dapp result; completion still publishes exactly one
`txResult` or bundle status for the original request. Removing or rejecting the
source also removes its generated cleanup.

Private-key and seed-phrase EOAs expose the actions only where the existing
WalletChan EIP-7702 atomic-batch capability is available. Safe proposals expose
it on supported Safe chains only while the proposal is unsigned and editable;
the background rebuilds the same-nonce proposal with the exact final
zero-value Safe CALL set after re-verifying the live Safe configuration and
version. Bankr requests expose cleanup on Bankr-supported chains through
the existing atomic Bankr batch path, including single-transaction conversion
and staged cross-dapp batches. Original source entries retain their pinned
credential tags; generated cleanup inherits source authorization and creates
no independent provider result. Changed calls invalidate exact-call fee quotes.
Ledger and impersonator reviews remain informational because neither has a
released atomic request-mutation path. The renderer's disabled state is
presentation only: every background handler independently rechecks the pinned
account, chain capability, request phase, aggregate call limit, duplicate
cleanup, and every source identity under the owning storage lock.

Permission-increase projection never uses the balance/allowance state
overrides employed by asset-preview retry. Residual projection uses only its
isolated trace/allowance simulator methods and never affects
signing/submission. Candidate rows are capped at 64; static recursion is capped
at four levels and 128 calls; configured RPC request/response/deadline bounds
still apply. Opaque calldata or malformed RPC output never produces a verified
claim on its own. ERC-7674 temporary approvals and Permit2 residual cleanup are
outside the current scope.

### Gas Estimation

`src/chrome/gasEstimation.ts` + `src/components/GasEstimateDisplay.tsx`:

Pre-confirmation gas estimation shown on the transaction confirmation screen. Fetches gas limit, EIP-1559 fees, sender balance, and native token USD price.

The historical `gasEstimation.ts`, `feeEstimation.ts`, and
`batchGasEstimation.ts` paths are policy-free compatibility facades. Focused
implementations live under `chrome/gas/`: fee math and fee RPC fallbacks,
single transaction policy/orchestration, and the sequential batch
`eth_simulateV1` -> TxSimulator injection -> independent-estimate fallback
ladder are separately auditable. See `chrome/gas/README.md`.

**Background estimation (`gasEstimation.ts` + `feeEstimation.ts`):**

- Uses viem `createPublicClient` with cached clients (keyed by chainId) and the shared configured-RPC resolver
- Parallel RPC calls: `estimateGas` (gas limit + 20% buffer), `estimateFeeTiers` (EIP-1559 fees from `eth_feeHistory`), `getBalance` (sender balance)
- CoinGecko price fetch with 60s in-memory cache for USD display
- Background CoinGecko service with shared storage-backed cache for native asset prices/logos
- If dapp provided gas params (`gas`, `maxFeePerGas`, `maxPriorityFeePerGas`, `gasPrice`), uses them as defaults and suppresses the tier picker
- Legacy dapp `gasPrice` is treated as the total per-gas price when translated to EIP-1559: `maxFeePerGas = gasPrice` and `maxPriorityFeePerGas = max(gasPrice - baseFee, 0)`. It must never be copied into both fields, which would double-count base fee and falsely block confirmation.
- Returns `GasEstimate` with `dappProvidedGas` flag, optional `tiers` (Slow / Standard / Fast preset fees), and `predictedNextBaseFee`

**Fee estimation (`feeEstimation.ts`):**

`estimateFeeTiers(client, chainId)` is the single source of truth for EIP-1559 fees. It runs `eth_feeHistory` over the last 10 blocks at the 50p reward, applies an IQR outlier filter + zero-tip drop, and emits three tiers: **slow = p25 / standard = p60 / fast = p90** of the cleaned sample. Each tier's `maxFeePerGas` is `predictedNextBaseFee × multiplier + tip` (multipliers: slow 1.25× / standard 1.50× / fast 2.00×). Ethereum mainnet uses a positive 100,000 wei (0.0001 gwei) priority floor when recent nonzero block rewards or a positive `eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas` response are available. This is a dust floor, not an inclusion guarantee or a fixed suggested tip: higher observed demand still wins. Tier spacing remains 12%; gas-limit buffers and base-fee headroom are unchanged. Missing, all-zero, malformed, or unsupported history falls back to the configured RPC priority suggestion; if that is also unusable, the previous 0.05 gwei Ethereum fallback remains. The legacy gas-price fallback and all other networks retain their previous floors. Fee history accepts at most ten single-percentile rows of bounded unsigned hex quantities. No fee-service endpoint or account-bearing request is introduced. Replacement requests still enforce their original-fee bump even when current market estimates are cheaper. `estimateFees()` is a thin wrapper that returns the standard tier — used by force-inclusion paths and any caller that doesn't want the picker. The `predictedNextBaseFee` is the EIP-1559 next-block predictor (no decreases — sticky downward to avoid stuck-tx pathology).

**UI component (`GasEstimateDisplay.tsx`) + tier picker (`GasTierPicker.tsx`):**

- Collapsible box showing estimated gas fee in ETH + USD (collapsed) with detailed breakdown (expanded)
- **PK/Seed accounts** with tiers available: 4-button segmented control (Slow / Standard / Fast / Custom) at the top of the expanded panel. Tier selection auto-populates the Priority + Max Fee inputs from the corresponding preset. Last preset choice persists to `chrome.storage.sync.defaultGasTier`.
- **Custom tier** opens the editable Priority + Max Fee + Gas Limit rows. Priority and Max Fee are coupled: editing Priority recomputes Max Fee = predictedNextBaseFee × 1.5 + Priority unless the user has manually edited Max Fee (sticky-edit; flips a `[linked] → [manual]` badge). The relink icon next to the badge restores the formula. Max Fee < Base Fee + Priority blocks Confirm (bubbled to parent via `onValidityChange`).
- **Bankr accounts**: All read-only with "Gas managed by Bankr API" note. Picker hidden.
- **Impersonator accounts**: All read-only. No Confirm button.
- When dapp provided gas params, picker is suppressed and the editable fields show in Custom-style mode.

**Batch tx tier picker (`MultiTxGasEstimateDisplay.tsx`):**

For non-atomic PK/SP batches (and cross-dapp batches), one shared `<GasTierPicker>` at the top applies its Priority / Max Fee uniformly to every call. Per-call gas limit editor stays as before. Atomic Bankr batches keep their server-managed gas UX. Same Custom-tier coupling rules as the single-tx editor.

**Dapp-provided gas as a floor (non-atomic path):** When the input transactions carry a `tx.gas` value (e.g., a swap response from `/api/swap/quote` whose gas was already estimated + buffered server-side), the component clamps each per-call gas limit to `max(simulated × buffer, dapp_tx_gas)` after `estimateBatchGasSequential` returns. This prevents simulator under-estimates — `eth_simulateV1` has been observed ~25% below real need for Uniswap V4-with-hooks swaps on Base, regardless of RPC provider — from silently downgrading a correct API value at signing time. The user can still edit downward in the picker. See `_docs/SWAP.md` ("Gas budgeting") for the full background.

**Ordered local multi-tx broadcast:** Non-atomic PK/SP dapp batches and direct
swap/bridge multi-tx submissions pre-assign sequential nonces, then broadcast
one raw transaction at a time. Each signed tx still carries explicit gas and fee
params so no gas/fee estimation runs during broadcast. If nonce N fails before
the raw tx is accepted, the nonce cache is reset and nonce N+1... rows are
marked failed/skipped instead of being signed; this prevents stale higher-nonce
transactions from executing later after a future user tx fills the gap. If the
RPC may have accepted nonce N but its response was lost, the locally derived
hash is retained as `broadcastUncertain`, the higher-nonce tail is skipped, and
the current row remains pending instead of inviting a retry at another nonce.

**Warnings:**
| Condition | Display |
|---|---|
| `eth_estimateGas` reverts | Red banner: "TX MAY REVERT: {reason}" |
| gas cost + tx value > balance | Yellow banner: "INSUFFICIENT BALANCE FOR GAS" |
| RPC unreachable | Muted text: "Gas estimate unavailable" (non-blocking) |
| CoinGecko fails | ETH amount shown, no USD |
| Invalid user gas input | Red border on field, overrides nullified |

**Gas overrides flow (PK/Seed accounts only):**

```
GasEstimateDisplay → onGasOverrides(overrides) → TransactionConfirmation state
  → confirmTransactionAsyncPK message includes gasOverrides
  → transactions/localExecution.ts merges into tx (clears legacy gasPrice to avoid EIP-1559 conflict)
  → signAndBroadcastTransaction(privateKey, txWithGas, rpcUrl)
```

**Editable transaction nonce flow (PK/Seed/Ledger native-gas only):**

```
TransactionConfirmation → getTransactionNonce(txId) reads the pinned account
  → Advanced details edits a validated decimal nonce
  → confirmTransactionAsyncPK / confirmTransactionAsyncLedger includes nonce
  → localExecution / ledger transactionExecution reserves and signs that exact nonce
```

**Shared utilities (`lib/gasFormatUtils.ts`):** `formatEth()`, `formatGwei()`, `formatNumber()` — extracted from `TxDetailModal.tsx` for reuse.

### Fee-token gas payment (Pimlico ERC-4337 v0.7)

`src/chrome/feePayment/` is the isolated ERC-4337/Pimlico domain for paying a
transaction fee in an address-pinned Pimlico token while retaining the current native-gas path.
The complete architecture and rollout gates are in
[`_docs/GAS_ABSTRACTION.md`](./GAS_ABSTRACTION.md).

The implemented domain contains:

- `constants.ts`: WalletChan's official Stateless DeleGator and its immutable
  EntryPoint v0.7 address;
- `tokens.ts`: address-pinned native/ERC-20 capability catalog. The current
  live-verified matrix is Ethereum (USDC, USDT, stETH, wstETH, WETH), Optimism
  (USDC, USDC.e, USDT, stETH, wstETH), Base/Polygon/Arbitrum (USDC, USDT), BNB
  Chain/Linea (USDT), MegaETH (USDm, USDT0), Monad (USDC, WMON), and USDC on
  Ethereum Sepolia, Optimism Sepolia, Arbitrum Sepolia, Polygon Amoy, and Base
  Sepolia;
- `pimlicoTypes.ts`: local v0.7 PackedUserOperation, EIP-7702 authorization,
  quote, paymaster, gas-estimate, and receipt shapes;
- `pimlicoClient.ts`: bounded JSON-RPC transport for token quotes, paymaster
  stub/final data, gas-price tiers, UserOperation estimation/submission, and
  receipts;
- `userOperation.ts`: byte-compatible single/batch DeleGator calldata, v0.7
  packing, the official recoverable estimation stub,
  and `EIP7702StatelessDeleGator` EIP-712 signing;
- `authorization.ts`: converts WalletChan's existing local EIP-7702 signature
  into Pimlico RPC shape and enforces the third-party-sender rule: the tuple
  uses the EOA's current nonce, not the direct type-4 path's `txNonce + 1`;
- `paymaster.ts`: Pimlico singleton-paymaster maximum-cost arithmetic and exact
  selected-token approval construction;
- `prepareUserOperation.ts`: quote -> unsigned dummy-approval simulation ->
  allowance-aware bounded approval -> stub paymaster data -> final gas estimate
  -> signed paymaster data. The signed paymaster response is always applied
  last; no UserOperation field is estimated or mutated afterward. Optional gas
  limits omitted by the final paymaster response preserve the last successful
  estimate instead of being reset to zero.
- `chainState.ts`: configured-RPC reads for the official onchain delegate,
  EntryPoint nonce, EOA authorization nonce, token balance, and paymaster
  allowance;
- `quotes.ts`: 45-second in-memory quotes pinned to request family/id, exact
  calls, account, chain, EntryPoint nonce, and delegation state. Fresh accounts
  use a dummy `eip7702Auth` plus an exact sender-code state override during
  estimation, so the official delegate executes for gas/paymaster simulation
  without creating or exposing a real authorization signature before the final
  Confirm action. The proxy permits only the operation sender and the official
  `0xef0100 || delegate` designator in that override, and never permits an
  override on submission;
- `signing.ts`: local PK/seed EIP-712 signing or Bankr `/wallet/sign` signing,
  with recovered-signer verification inherited from `bankr/signing.ts`;
- `execution.ts`, `batchExecution.ts`, and
  `crossDappBatch/feePayment.ts`: consume a quote once, recheck account, nonce,
  delegation, balance, allowance, and pending-request authorization, then sign
  and submit the exact final UserOperation;
- `submission.ts`: computes the exact EntryPoint v0.7 UserOperation hash,
  persists that hash and public routing fields immediately before broadcast,
  removes it after a definite rejection, and retains it when the submit
  response is outcome-unknown;
- `receiptValidation.ts`: independently fetches the chain receipt and requires
  a matching EntryPoint `UserOperationEvent` for the exact hash and sender
  before Activity or ERC-5792 status becomes terminal; the verified event also
  supplies the exact paymaster used to classify the settled token charge;
- `pendingOperations.ts` and `recovery.ts`: serialize bounded recovery-record
  mutations and reconcile deterministic hashes after MV3 restarts without
  persisting calldata, authorization tuples, or UserOperation signatures;
- `capabilities.ts`: native/token eligibility for pinned single, ERC-5792,
  cross-dapp batch, Safe-execution, and reviewed internal Swap calls, including
  precise fresh-account, different-delegate, Bankr, RPC, deployment, and
  unsupported-chain outcomes. Cross-dapp discovery resolves the active batch
  and exact pinned account in the background; the renderer supplies only its
  synthetic request ID.

The client accepts only an HTTPS WalletChan proxy URL (localhost is allowed for
development), uses the shared bounded HTTP reader, omits ambient credentials
and referrers, pins JSON-RPC IDs, validates all returned hex/address fields,
rejects unrequested token quotes, and rejects a paymaster address that changes
after quote selection. A Pimlico API key must never be compiled into the
extension.

`FeePaymentSelector.tsx` is shared by normal, ERC-5792, cross-dapp,
executable Safe, and in-wallet Swap confirmation. Normal
confirmation includes injected and WalletConnect transactions, extension-
initiated Send requests, replacements, and other requests persisted through
the pinned single-transaction queue. It uses
the standard bottom action sheet, keeps native payment as the default, shows
amount, stablecoin fiat equivalence, live balance, and insufficiency for native
and every funded catalog token, identifies assets with their token logos where available, discloses a one-time
official smart-account upgrade, and disables Confirm until a current
request-pinned quote exists. The parent confirmation owns the completed quote;
the selector derives its displayed maximum and balance from that same object
instead of keeping a second copy. Native and force-inclusion paths remain
unchanged; there is no silent fallback from a failed token operation to native
payment.

At Safe quorum, the selector is keyed by the proposal ID and currently selected
private-key/seed-phrase executor. Option discovery reads that executor's token
balances and delegation on the proposal chain. A quote binds the exact outer
`execTransaction` call, Safe proposal, chain, executor account/address, and
EntryPoint/delegation snapshot. Switching executors restores native payment and
invalidates the old quote. Token-funded Safe execution persists only the
deterministic UserOperation hash plus public executor/fee-token routing data;
startup and alarm reconciliation require the matching onchain EntryPoint event
before applying the Safe result or returning the real transaction hash to the
connected app.

Cross-dapp confirmation uses the same batch fee row, action sheet, quote
loading/error states, native default, and Advanced fee disclosure as an
ERC-5792 batch. Its `crossDappBatch` quote family binds the active batch's
creation-derived request ID, exact ordered calls, account ID/address, chain,
nonce, delegate, token, and paymaster state. Edited or appended calls reset the
selection to native. Confirm revalidates every contributing
injected/WalletConnect authority before signing and again immediately before
broadcast. Source dapp promises remain pending until an independently verified
EntryPoint receipt supplies the real transaction hash; a bounded public-only
map of transaction and ERC-5792 bundle IDs lets restart recovery fan that one
result back to every source.

New token-funded history stores only `{ token, amountWei? }`: the lowercase
contract is committed before broadcast and the settled base-unit charge is
filled from the verified paymaster's onchain `UserOperationSponsored` event.
Its exact `tokenAmountPaid` identifies a matching treasury debit or
charge/refund pair even when the treasury differs from the paymaster contract.
Those transfers are removed from ordinary Balance changes without hiding
unrelated same-token activity. Metadata and price are resolved lazily through
the shared chain/address caches when Transaction details opens. Its compact fee pill and
Advanced gas section show the ERC-20 logo, amount, and USD value; outer bundler
native gas is never labeled as paid by the wallet. This applies equally to
successful and reverted UserOperations and to single, atomic batch, Swap,
bridge, and Safe executor history. Released symbol-only rows remain readable
but are not migrated.

The options request reads every catalog-token balance independently of Pimlico quote
preparation. An exact zero balance omits that catalog token before the options
leave the service worker; native remains available, while unknown reads retain
their existing `Balance unavailable` display and quote-time retry behavior
rather than being misclassified as zero. Once a token is
selected, the compact decision row is reserved for the bounded maximum fee;
the balance is not repeated there. The shared estimating loader is centered
across that row while preparation is pending.

The in-wallet Swap confirmation puts the pinned signing account, shared fee
selector, native gas editor, and final actions in the same non-scrolling bottom
bar used by other transaction reviews. Its renderer creates a fresh internal
request ID for the staged plan and sends only the reviewed chain and bounded
calls for option discovery/quote preparation. The in-memory quote uses the
`internalSwap` family and binds that ID, exact calls, pinned account/address,
chain, nonce, delegate, token, and paymaster state. Final token-paid execution
re-resolves the locked account, revalidates every prepared `from`/chain, consumes
the exact quote once, and routes Bankr or PK/seed signing through the existing
atomic fee-payment batch executor. Native Bankr batch, local EIP-7702, and
sequential swap execution remain unchanged. Ledger and impersonator accounts
cannot select token-paid gas; Safe swaps continue into the Safe proposal flow,
whose executor-specific fee selection happens at quorum.

When simulation shows that the requested transaction would spend too much of the selected token
for the paymaster to collect its fee (`AA50 postOp reverted 0x7939f424`), the
confirmation replaces the provider code with recovery guidance: reduce the
transaction amount or choose another fee token. Other provider errors remain
unchanged for accurate diagnosis.

Fee-option discovery has a 10-second renderer deadline and quote preparation
has a 30-second renderer deadline. A missing response invalidates that request,
stops the loading state, and presents an explicit Retry action. Quote errors do
not automatically retry. A per-request attempt guard prevents the renderer
from interpreting the callback's completion render as a new idle request, and
selector rerenders never clear a completed parent-owned quote. A valid quote
remains usable until its actual expiry; expiry disables Confirm and presents
explicit Retry without starting another provider request. While preparation is
pending, the row uses the shared three-shape/dot loader with “Estimating Fees”.
Switching back to native also cancels the renderer's pending quote state.
Provider calls remain independently bounded in the background transport.

Private-key and seed-phrase accounts can attach the one-time official
authorization in the same submitted UserOperation. Bankr accounts use the
remote typed-data signer only when the official delegate is already active;
fresh Bankr accounts receive a precise setup requirement because Bankr does
not expose the special EIP-7702 authorization signer. View-only impersonator
accounts cannot quote or confirm. Contract deployments, Ledger token-funded
signing, impersonated transactions, Max calculations, and force inclusion
remain outside the token-payment execution gate.

The dummy approval uses `uint256.max` only in an unsigned estimation envelope,
matching Pimlico's maintained `permissionless.js` helper. It is always replaced
before typed-data signing: the submitted calls contain either no approval when
the current allowance is sufficient, or `approve(quotedPaymaster,
maximumTokenCost)` for the computed bound. If final paymaster data changes the
bound, preparation rebuilds once and fails closed if the cost does not
stabilize. Every rebuild repeats stub -> estimate -> final paymaster data, so
Pimlico never signs an envelope whose gas fields are subsequently replaced.
Quotes above the selected catalog token's absolute base-unit ceiling are
rejected before signing (100 units for stablecoins and one unit for the
currently enabled non-stable assets).

The website proxy at `/api/gas/pimlico/[chainId]` keeps `PIMLICO_API_KEY`
server-side and is policy-constrained rather than a general authenticated RPC.
Its `tokens.ts` mirrors the extension's exact chain/token address catalog. It
pins every allowed method to WalletChan's EntryPoint and that catalog, bounds
bodies/time/rate, and authenticates submission by recovering the
exact WalletChan sender EIP-712 signature before forwarding
`eth_sendUserOperation`. Attached 7702 authorizations must cryptographically
recover to that same sender and use the official delegate and exact route
chain. `PIMLICO_PROXY_DISABLED=true` is the operational kill switch.

Every built-in EVM chain addition runs the Pimlico discovery and live-quote
gate in `.agents/skills/walletchan-chain-research/SKILL.md`. The extension fee
catalog and website proxy catalog must change together; the fee-payment token
test compares their normalized chain/address sets so one-sided updates fail.

## Signature Request Handling

Signature support differs by account type:

| Account Type | Signature Support                           |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Private Key  | ✅ Full support (sign locally with viem)    |
| Seed Phrase  | ✅ Full support (sign locally with viem)    |
| Ledger       | ✅ Personal sign + supported EIP-712        |
| Impersonator | ❌ Disabled (view-only)                     |
| Safe         | ❌ EOA-style message signing is unsupported |
| Bankr API    | ✅ Via `/wallet/sign` API                   |

When dapps request signatures, the extension displays the request details.
Private Key and Seed Phrase accounts sign locally with viem, Ledger accounts
sign supported requests on-device, and impersonator and Safe accounts can only
reject. Optional Bankr accounts sign through the `/wallet/sign` API endpoint.

### Supported Signature Methods

| Method                 | Description                      |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `personal_sign`        | Sign a plain text message        |
| `eth_sign`             | Sign arbitrary data (deprecated) |
| `eth_signTypedData`    | Sign typed data (EIP-712)        |
| `eth_signTypedData_v3` | Sign typed data v3               |
| `eth_signTypedData_v4` | Sign typed data v4               |

### UI Display

The SignatureRequestConfirmation component shows:

- The standard request header and shared combined-queue controls
- Centered requesting-app identity via `RequestIdentity`
- A plain-language signature summary before any raw data
- Readable personal-message, SIWE, clear-signed, delegation, or structured
  EIP-712 fields as the primary content
- Network, method, raw payload/parameters, typed-data domain/types, and hashes
  under the shared Advanced details disclosure
- The same compact `Signing with` footer geometry as transaction requests
- Secondary Reject and amber `brand` Sign actions in `StickyActionBar`

The flat `SignatureRequestConfirmation.tsx` path is a compatibility facade. The
implementation and presentation modules live in
`components/SignatureConfirmation/`; they compose `ConfirmationScreen`,
`RequestConfirmation/QueueNavigation`, `RequestIdentity`, `StickyActionBar`,
and `shared/LabeledAddressPopover` instead of cloning transaction markup.

External ERC-7710 `Delegation` typed-data requests are rejected before they are
stored as pending signatures. Dapps must use ERC-7715 permission methods
instead; WalletChan-generated delegation signing must stay on an internal path.

**For Bankr API Accounts:**

- Sign button (yellow): Signs via `/wallet/sign` API
- Reject button (white/secondary): Cancels the request

**For Private Key / Seed Phrase Accounts:**

- Sign button (yellow): Signs the message locally
- Reject button (white/secondary): Cancels the request

### SIWE Validation and Display

`personal_sign` messages that match EIP-4361 ("Sign-In With Ethereum") are parsed
with `src/lib/siwe` and rendered by `SiweMessageDisplay` instead of the generic
raw-message block.

**Human-readable display:**

- "Sign in to {domain}" summary followed by the SIWE statement
- URI, issued/expiration times, request ID, nonce, and resources without
  repeating the already-visible requesting site, pinned signer, or network
- Validation status and issue list
- Raw SIWE message and request parameters inside shared Advanced details

**Validation performed:**

1. EIP-4361 required structure and field ordering
2. Domain, address, URI, version, chain ID, nonce, and RFC 3339 timestamps
   - Nonce warnings use a 32-bit estimated-entropy floor plus explicit common,
     sequential, repeated-run, and repeated-pattern checks. Long random hex
     values are evaluated by their distribution rather than a length-dependent
     unique-character ratio.
3. Expiration / not-before timing
4. Message domain ↔ URI host consistency
5. Connected site origin, connected chain, and signing account match. For
   dapp-originated requests, SIWE uses the Chrome-attested `sender.origin`
   captured as `senderOrigin` when available, falling back to the persisted
   request origin for legacy entries and WalletConnect peers.

Validation is run in the UI for user review and again in
`signatures/confirmationPolicy.ts` before signing for every signing-capable
account type. Both the local and Bankr confirmation handlers consume this same
preflight, so request presence, pinned-account resolution, raw ERC-7710 rejection, signer
matching, and SIWE origin checks cannot drift between transports. If a SIWE
message has validation errors, the Sign button stays disabled until the user
opens the sticky decision-bar warning popover and checks its explicit
acknowledgement checkbox. Confirmation then sends the extension-only `allowUnsafeSiwe`
confirmation flag so the background handler can skip SIWE validation for that
request. The dapp-supplied signer parameter must still match the pinned account;
that check is separate from SIWE validation and is not bypassable.

### Combined Navigation

When both transaction and signature requests are pending:

- Counter shows combined total (e.g., "1/3" for 2 tx + 1 sig)
- Transaction requests appear first in the list
- Navigation arrows allow moving between all request types
- "Reject all" uses App's global queue handler and rejects transactions,

### EIP-712 Validation (v1.4.0+)

Before storing or displaying EIP-712 signature requests, typed data is validated to prevent malicious attacks.

**When**: Before storing in `pendingSignatureRequests`
**Methods validated**: `eth_signTypedData_v3`, `eth_signTypedData_v4`
**Location**: `transactions/requestIntake.ts:handleSignatureRequest()`

**Checks performed**:

1. Schema structure (domain, types, primaryType, message fields exist)
2. Circular reference detection (DFS traversal)
3. Nesting depth limit (50 levels maximum)
4. Type definition conformance (all referenced types exist and are valid)
5. External requests cannot use the signer or any stored direct signing EOA as
   `domain.verifyingContract` (case-insensitive), regardless of primary type,
   calldata, delegation settings, or request origin labels.

`signatures/externalTypedData.ts` follows MetaMask's EOA-only internal-account
filter: it supplies stored PK, seed, Ledger, and Bankr addresses plus the pinned
signer to the pure validator. Imported Safe and view-only records do not add
protected addresses. Injected intake and WalletConnect
both enforce this before persistence. Shared confirmation repeats it for PK,
seed, Ledger, and Bankr, including requests persisted by older builds; the SIWE
override cannot bypass it. Final signature release rechecks under the wallet
operation lock to catch another account imported during signing. The content
bridge also suppresses early request-surface opening for a signer-domain match,
without receiving the wallet's other account addresses.

The external confirmation/release policy also rejects deprecated `eth_sign` and
unversioned `eth_signTypedData` requests persisted by older builds, matching
current provider intake. This prevents the legacy typed-data alias accepted by
low-level signers from bypassing V3/V4 protection. EIP-712 field definitions are
validated before delegation inspection or graph traversal so malformed fields
produce a normal rejection rather than throwing from the validator.
If Ledger signing completes but final authority validation rejects release,
the pending request is removed so the background publishes the rejection to
the dapp. Pre-sign device/session failures retain the existing retry behavior.
The injected provider classifies the account-domain policy error as an expected
signature rejection (fallback code 4001), reusing its existing quiet rejection
logging path. Genuine signer/transport failures continue to produce warnings.

This blocks `PackedUserOperation` execution-signature phishing against imported
or already-delegated EOAs, along with other self-verifying account formats.
External owner signatures with an imported Safe as the verifier remain supported;
there is no primary-type exemption, so `SafeTx` cannot bypass a protected EOA
match. Internal fee-token UserOperation construction and Safe-owner approvals
use their separate signing paths and remain available. No origin string or `trustedInternal` flag
bypasses this policy on the generic signature-request path.

**On validation failure**:

- Console error with details logged
- Background writes error to `chrome.storage.local` under `sigResult:{sigId}` so the content script picks it up
- Dapp receives: `{ success: false, error: "Data must conform to EIP-712 schema" }`
- No popup shown
- Request not stored in pending signature requests

`eip712Validator.ts` is the stable policy-free facade. Validation ownership is
split under `signatures/eip712/` across `validator.ts` (bounded orchestration),
`delegationPolicy.ts` (raw delegation rejection), `accountDomainPolicy.ts`
(internal-account verifying-contract rejection), `schemaValidation.ts` (pure
graph/type checks), and `sanitization.ts` (schema-only projection). Request
intake owns only the integration and durable rejection result.

**Files**: `eip712Validator.ts` (stable facade),
`signatures/eip712/` (validation policy),
`transactions/requestIntake.ts` (integration)

## Async Transaction Confirmation

When a user confirms a transaction, the extension uses an async flow that allows the popup to close immediately while processing continues in the background.

```

### Success Animation (Popup Mode Only)

When confirming a transaction in popup mode, a full-screen success animation is shown:

```typescript
// Animation keyframes
const scaleIn = keyframes`
  0% { transform: scale(0); opacity: 0; }
  50% { transform: scale(1.2); }
  100% { transform: scale(1); opacity: 1; }
`;

const checkmarkDraw = keyframes`
  0% { stroke-dashoffset: 50; }
  100% { stroke-dashoffset: 0; }
`;
```

The animation shows:

- Green circular badge with animated checkmark
- "Transaction Sent" heading
- "Your transaction has been submitted" subtext
- Auto-closes popup after 1 second

In sidepanel mode, the view navigates back immediately without the animation (sidepanel stays open for further interactions).

### Receipt Polling & Flashblocks

After a tx is broadcast, `txReceiptPoller.startReceiptPolling(txId, txHash, chainId)` polls `eth_getTransactionReceipt` until a receipt is found or the 10-minute timeout elapses. Default cadence: 2s initial, 1.5× exponential backoff up to 30s. OP Stack force-inclusion L2 hashes are derived from the confirmed L1 deposit rather than broadcast into the L2 mempool, so a missing `eth_getTransactionByHash` result is expected during derivation and is never classified as a mempool drop. Those hashes receive a 15-minute polling window around the expected 1-10 minute inclusion delay. The fee-bearing L1 deposit receipt is projected into the transaction's existing `gasData` history field as soon as it confirms; derived L2 finalization preserves that record instead of replacing it with the zero-cost L2 deposit receipt. Startup recovery backfills the L1 gas record for older successful force-inclusion entries as well as reopening entries incorrectly terminalized by the former 60-second mempool heuristic.

Local PK/seed broadcasts are prepared and signed exactly once. The transaction
hash is derived from those serialized bytes before the RPC effect. A transport
timeout/disconnect after `eth_sendRawTransaction` is therefore an ambiguous
success, not a definite failure: history stores the deterministic hash plus
`broadcastUncertain: true`. Repeated `eth_getTransactionByHash` misses cannot
classify that row as dropped until an RPC first observes the hash; a receipt or
observed transaction clears the marker. This prevents a user retry from
executing the same approved intent again at a different nonce.

Ordinary PK/seed/Ledger history records persist the exact signed nonce. If both
receipt and transaction lookup miss, a configured-RPC `latest` account nonce
strictly greater than that stored nonce proves the transaction can no longer
land and terminalizes it immediately as `dropped`. Otherwise the conservative
60-second / three-observation fallback remains. A mined Cancel or Speed Up
receipt also marks its exact still-pending replacement chain `dropped`
immediately. Dropped
is a distinct history status from `failed`, which remains reserved for signing,
broadcast, or onchain execution failures.

For dapp, WalletConnect, cross-dapp, and force-inclusion local paths,
`prepareSignAndBroadcastTransaction` invokes an async `beforeBroadcast` hook
after RPC preparation and local signing, immediately before the raw send. The
hook re-resolves the pinned account and performs the final transport
authorization/epoch commit before beginning the effect lease. A navigation,
permission revoke, WalletConnect disconnect, account removal, or wallet reset
during transaction preparation therefore discards the signed bytes without
broadcasting them. The shared wallet-secret operation lock is held across
preparation, this final check, and the raw send, so account removal/conversion,
session termination, password change, and reset cannot interleave in the
validation-to-send gap.

Chains marked with `supportsFlashblocks: true` in `CHAIN_REGISTRY` (Base, Unichain, Optimism) get an additional **fast phase**: 250ms polling for the first ~5s before the standard schedule kicks in. This delivers ~250ms user-perceived confirmation. The default RPCs for all three (`mainnet.base.org`, `mainnet.unichain.org`, `mainnet.optimism.io`) are already Flashblocks-aware — `eth_getTransactionReceipt` resolves at Flashblock pace without any URL change. Premium providers (Alchemy, QuickNode, Chainstack) also serve Flashblocks data. On a non-Flashblocks-aware RPC the fast phase is harmless polling overhead — the receipt arrives at the normal ~2s mark and the loop transitions to standard backoff.

To enable Flashblocks for another chain, set `supportsFlashblocks: true` on its `CHAIN_REGISTRY` entry. The `FLASHBLOCKS_CHAIN_IDS` set auto-derives, no other code changes required.

### Sync Send (EIP-7966)

Chains marked with `supportsSyncSend: true` (MegaETH today) skip the receipt poller entirely on local-signed (PK/Seed) txs. `signAndBroadcastTransaction` in `localSigner.ts` signs the tx locally, then posts `eth_sendRawTransactionSync` directly to the RPC — the response is the **full receipt** in a single round trip (~100ms on MegaETH). The receipt is written directly to tx history via `applyReceiptToHistory()` in `forceInclusion/receiptPoller.ts`, no polling.

To avoid an intermediate "pending" flash on the activity tab, all three broadcast call sites (`processLocalTransactionInBackground` in `transactions/localExecution.ts`, `broadcastSwapTxLocal`, and the batch broadcast loop in `batch/batchSequentialExecution.ts`) branch on `result.receipt`: when present, jump straight to the final state via `applyReceiptToHistory`; otherwise mark the tx as `pending` and start the poller. The history's `txHash` field is now also written by `applyReceiptToHistory` so the sync-send path doesn't need a placeholder write.

**MegaETH RPC quirk:** EIP-7966 specifies the `timeout` param as a hex-encoded Quantity (`"0x1388"` for 5000ms), and viem's `sendRawTransactionSync` follows the spec via `numberToHex(timeout)`. MegaETH's RPC rejects this with `Invalid params: timeout must be a positive number` and only accepts a plain integer. We bypass viem's wrapper and call `client.request({ method: "eth_sendRawTransactionSync", params: [serialized, 5000] })` directly. The receipt comes back in raw RPC shape (status `"0x1"`/`"0x0"`, hex bigints) which `applyReceiptToHistory` already normalizes for both viem-formatted and raw receipts.

If the sync call throws or times out (5s), the broadcaster retries the **same
serialized transaction bytes** through `eth_sendRawTransaction`; it never
re-prepares or re-signs. If that fallback response is also lost, the
deterministic local hash is persisted under the ambiguity rules above and
receipt polling continues.

The same path covers ERC-5792 batched txs because the ERC-7821 wrapper is itself a single signed tx. For PK/SP EIP-7702 wrappers, inner `Call.value` amounts stay encoded and visible to the user, but the signed outer EOA self-call uses `value: 0x0` to avoid a redundant native transfer to self. Bankr-API accounts are unaffected (MegaETH is `isBankrSupported: false`).

### Post-confirm Asset Changes Extraction

After a tx confirms successfully, the receipt path fires-and-forgets `extractAndStoreAssetChanges` through the stable `chrome/assetChangesExtractor.ts` facade. The implementation is split under `chrome/history/`: pure ERC-20/ERC-721/ERC-1155 Transfer-log parsing, bounded receipt/balance RPC helpers, asset-change assembly, recent-token/history persistence, and delayed receipt/backfill policy are independently auditable (see `chrome/history/README.md`). Most txs flow through `applyReceiptToHistory` (in `forceInclusion/receiptPoller.ts`). Bankr direct-success paths (`transactions/bankrProcessing.ts`, `transactions/swaps/bankrLeg.ts`, `batch/batchBankrExecution.ts`, and `crossDappBatch/completion.ts`) use the stable `receiptEnrichment.ts` facade to retry `eth_getTransactionReceipt` asynchronously, because Bankr can return `success` before the user's configured RPC has indexed the receipt. For ERC-5792 responses, an immediately available raw receipt is converted to the sanitized `BundleReceipt` shape before storing it for `wallet_getCallsStatus`, while the raw receipt is kept for internal extraction. `TxDetailModal` also sends the extension-only `backfillAssetChanges` message when a confirmed history entry has a `txHash` but no current-version `assetChanges`, so old entries, legacy ERC-20-only snapshots, and service-worker-interrupted retries can repair themselves on open. The extractor:

1. Decodes the receipt's `logs[]` for ERC-20 `Transfer(from, to, amount)` events (topic0 = `0xddf252ad…`, exactly 3 topics — ERC-721 logs have 4 and are skipped naturally) where the lowercased `from` OR `to` matches the sender. Internal pool routing is filtered out.
2. Resolves `symbol/decimals/logoUrl` per unique token via `tokenMetadata.ts`, which shares swap-list, Bungee-list, watched-asset, and hardcoded-logo fallbacks.
3. Computes the sender's pure native-value flow as `balance(blockNumber) - balance(blockNumber-1) + gasCost`, where `gasCost = gasUsed * effectiveGasPrice + (l1Fee || 0)`. The historical-balance call retries up to 3× with 2s backoff to absorb load-balanced RPCs that briefly don't yet know about `blockNumber-1`; if it never resolves, `nativeDelta` is left undefined and the modal silently hides the row. For chains marked `supportsFlashblocks`, receipt-derived history first waits for one following block and verifies that a refreshed receipt's `blockHash` matches the canonical block before using its fee fields. This prevents a preconfirmed L1-fee estimate from surviving as a false native transfer. Opening Transaction details queues one reconciliation per mounted Flashblocks entry, including already-enriched history, so older gas/native snapshots are repaired from the same settled receipt; ordinary-chain snapshots remain immutable.
4. Attempts to seed `recentlyReceivedTokens` (5-minute TTL cache) for every inbound ERC-20 so `loadPortfolioTokenCatalog` (`chrome/portfolio/tokenCatalog.ts`) can inject a synthetic stub into the portfolio before the upstream portfolio API has re-indexed. This happens before the tx-history broadcast when storage succeeds, so Holdings can merge the stub immediately. A seed failure is logged but must not block writing `assetChanges`. The on-chain balance multicall in `TokenHoldings` overwrites balance with the live value; CoinGecko/GeckoTerminal backfills price while `tokenMetadata.ts` backfills any missing symbol/logo.
5. Decodes ERC-721 `Transfer` plus ERC-1155 `TransferSingle`/`TransferBatch` and persists only immutable transfer identity: contract, token ID, standard, amount, direction, and counterparty. NFT token URI, image, and display metadata are never durable history.
6. Writes the versioned `AssetChangeRecord` onto the existing history entry. Missing versions remain readable and are lazily re-enriched. If detailed transfer persistence fails, a best-effort `detailsIncomplete` marker preserves the settled summary without changing transaction success.

For native-flow reconciliation, direct transactions add the sender's outer
transaction gas back to the block-to-block balance delta. USDC-funded ERC-4337
history rows do not: the Pimlico bundler paid that outer gas, so adding its
receipt gas to the wallet's unchanged ETH balance would fabricate an inbound
ETH transfer. Initial extraction, receipt retries, and Activity backfill all
derive this distinction from `feePaymentToken`.

derive this distinction from `feePaymentToken`.

**Bridge destination leg.** When `bridgeStatusPoller.checkAndApplyStatus` sees a destination `txHash` arrive for the first time (`!priorEntry?.bridge?.destinationTxHash`), it fires `extractAndStoreDestinationAssetChanges` against the destination chain's RPC (resolved via `getRpcUrl`). Same decoder, `payerForGas: false` (the receiver didn't pay gas on the dest chain), written to `destAssetChanges`. The modal renders a second `AssetChangesCard` titled "On {destChainName}".

**Refresh wiring.** `updateTxInHistory()` broadcasts only `{ txId, ownerAddress, chainId, changedKeys }`; it never copies the history record or transfer arrays through runtime messaging. Activity refreshes the changed row with `getTxHistoryItem`. Holdings uses the compact identity/change fields for its delayed refresh policy.

**Durable history and lazy details.** IndexedDB database `walletchan-history` stores compact transaction summaries separately from ERC-20/NFT transfer rows. The first history access idempotently imports the released `chrome.storage.local.txHistory` array, then removes that legacy key only after all valid records commit. Settled rows omit full calldata and retain only the selector; NFT rows omit token URI, image, collection, symbol, and token name. Activity uses 30-row indexed cursor pages and an intersection sentinel for automatic loading. Retention keeps at most 1,000 settled entries per account/network and 50 MiB overall, without evicting processing/pending recovery rows. Transaction Details fetches calldata by stored transaction hash through the configured RPC and validates hash/from/to before using it. NFT display metadata is resolved through the configured RPC at the receipt block with latest-state fallback and a 24-hour, 500-entry, 10 MiB best-effort display cache; raw token URI is never sent to the renderer or stored.

Holdings keeps successful RPC balance reads (including zero-balance tombstones) authoritative across subsequent API revalidations. A lagging portfolio response may update token metadata and price, but it cannot overwrite a verified balance or resurrect a token that RPC already reported as zero. Failed per-token RPC reads are never marked authoritative, so a transient RPC error cannot freeze an API fallback as an onchain value. The same overlay is applied to the fast API paint and the detached enrichment pass, preventing either async stage from causing post-confirm balance flicker.

**Failure surface.** Both extraction paths are wrapped in try/catch + `console.warn`. A failing RPC, malformed receipt, or transient storage error must never block the confirmation notification (source path) or the bridge state machine (destination path).

### Per-chain gas buffer

All chains add a 20% buffer on top of `eth_estimateGas` to absorb state changes between estimate and inclusion. The buffer can be overridden per-chain via `gasBufferPct` on the registry entry (default 20). No chain currently overrides it.

### Non-standard gas models (MegaETH)

Some chains use gas accounting that differs from standard EVM. MegaETH uses a [dual gas model](https://github.com/megaeth-labs/mega-evm/blob/main/docs/DUAL_GAS_MODEL.md) — compute gas and storage gas tracked separately, plus SSTORE bucket multipliers that scale storage cost. Locally-computed gas values (dapp-provided, GAS-opcode-based simulation tricks) miss the storage component and systematically under-estimate, causing OOG reverts on storage-heavy ops like ERC20 approve.

Chains with `usesNonStandardGasModel: true` on the registry entry get three behavioral changes that all defer gas computation to the chain's own `eth_estimateGas` (which knows its model and is accurate):

1. **Intake strip** (`transactions/requestIntake.ts` `handleTransactionRequest`): the dapp's `tx.gas` field is removed before storing as a pending request. All downstream code (UI estimation, signing) sees `gas: undefined` and re-estimates via the chain.
2. **Single-tx UI estimation** (`gasEstimation.ts`): `dappGas` is forced to `null` so the standard `eth_estimateGas + 20% buffer` path always runs.
3. **Batch UI estimation** (`batchGasEstimation.ts`): tier 1 (`eth_simulateV1`) and tier 2 (TxSimulator bytecode injection via state override) are skipped. Tier 2 in particular counts gas via the GAS opcode, which only sees compute gas — wrong on dual-model chains. Falls through to tier 3's per-call `eth_estimateGas`. For dependent calls (e.g., swap-after-approve) where the prior call hasn't been broadcast yet, the per-call estimate fails and tier 3's `DEPENDENT_CALL_GAS_LIMIT` (500k) fallback kicks in with `fallbackUsed: true` flagged to the UI.

Fee fields (`maxFeePerGas`, `maxPriorityFeePerGas`, `gasPrice`) are still honored — under-priced fees only delay inclusion, they don't cause reverts.

MegaETH is the only chain with this flag set today.

## Browser Notifications

The extension uses Chrome's Notifications API to alert users when transactions complete while the popup/sidepanel is closed.

### Notification Types

| Event                 | Title                   | Message                                          |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Transaction Confirmed | "Transaction Confirmed" | "Your transaction on {chainName} was successful" |
| Transaction Failed    | "Transaction Failed"    | "Error: {errorMessage}"                          |
| Dapp Chain Switch     | "Switched to {chainName}" | "{origin} switched WalletChan network"         |

**See**: `src/chrome/transactions/notification.ts` -> `showNotification()` for the shared
helper and `src/chrome/background/chainPromptRouter.ts` plus
`background/chainSwitchNotification.ts` for dapp-initiated chain switch
notifications. Chain switch notifications pass the
resolved local chain icon as `iconUrl` when one is available, and fall back to
the WalletChan icon if Chrome rejects the asset.

### macOS Permissions Note

On macOS, Chrome notifications require explicit permission in System Preferences:

- **System Preferences → Notifications → Google Chrome → Allow Notifications**

Without this permission, `chrome.notifications.create()` will execute without error but no notification will appear.

### Manifest Permission

The `"notifications"` permission is required in `manifest.json`.

## Transaction History

Completed transactions (confirmed or failed) are stored persistently and displayed on the homepage.

### Data Model

**See**: `src/chrome/history/types.ts` for the released `CompletedTransaction` interface and `TxStatus` type; `src/chrome/txHistoryStorage.ts` remains the compatibility import path. Each entry tracks the transaction params, origin, chain, status (processing/success/failed), timestamps, and result (txHash or error).

Additional fields populated after transaction submission:

- `accountType` — `"bankr" | "privateKey" | "seedPhrase"` — which account type submitted the tx
- `functionName` — Human-readable function name extracted from decoded calldata (see Function Name Resolution below)
- `batchCallOrigins` — optional `{ origin, favicon }[]` captured for cross-dapp batch history entries. It aligns one-to-one with the encoded ERC-7821 calls so TxDetailModal can render each contributing dapp in the decoded call list; old entries fall back to the batch-level `origin/favicon`.
- `privacyRagequitMeta` — optional public `{version: 1}` classification marker
  for a Privacy Pools public exit. It carries no operation ID, commitment,
  label, proof, or recovery material and keeps the row in Private Activity.
- `gasData` — Gas fee breakdown fetched asynchronously after tx confirms (see Gas Data Fetching below)
- `clearSignedMeta.tokenDecimals` — optional additive precision snapshot used
  by Activity to distinguish exact base-unit values from merely small decimal
  values. Older entries fall back to receipt transfer metadata or known native
  chain metadata and remain compatible when precision cannot be proven.

#### GasData Interface

```typescript
interface GasData {
  gasUsed: string; // decimal string
  gasLimit: string; // decimal string
  effectiveGasPrice: string; // decimal string (wei)
  feeSource?: "forceInclusionL1"; // authoritative paid L1 deposit fee
  // OP Stack L2 only (Base 8453, Unichain 130)
  l1Fee?: string; // decimal string (wei)
  l1GasUsed?: string; // decimal string
  l1GasPrice?: string; // decimal string (wei)
}
```

#### Function Name Resolution

Function names are resolved via a two-phase approach:

**Phase 1 (UI-driven)**: `TransactionConfirmation` decodes calldata locally via `CalldataDecoder`. If decoded, the `functionName` is passed in the confirmation message to background.

**Phase 2 (Background fallback)**: If the UI didn't provide a function name, `lookupFunctionName()` runs after tx submission and queries:

1. Sourcify 4byte API (`https://api.4byte.sourcify.dev/signature-database/v1/lookup`)
2. 4byte.directory (`https://www.4byte.directory/api/v1/signatures/`) as fallback

The resolved name is stored in tx history via `updateTxInHistory()`.

#### Gas Data Fetching

Gas data is not available at confirmation time (tx hasn't been mined). It's fetched asynchronously:

1. **After tx success**: `fetchAndStoreGasData()` in `transactions/displayMetadata.ts` runs fire-and-forget, calling `eth_getTransactionByHash` (gasLimit) and `eth_getTransactionReceipt` (gasUsed, effectiveGasPrice). For OP Stack L2s (Base 8453, Unichain 130), L1 fee fields (`l1Fee`, `l1GasUsed`, `l1GasPrice`) are extracted from the receipt. Flashblocks-capable chains pass through the shared sealed-receipt gate before gas data is persisted; transaction, batch, and receipt-polling paths share the same receipt projection, and Transaction details reconciliation updates cached gas data alongside asset changes. Force inclusion is the exception: its paid L1 deposit receipt is tagged with `feeSource: "forceInclusionL1"`, and the history repository preserves it against every later untagged L2 gas enrichment while still accepting asset-change updates.
2. **On-demand in TxDetailModal**: For older transactions missing `gasData`, the modal fetches directly via RPC when opened.
3. **Graceful degradation**: Errors are silently ignored (non-critical data).

### Storage Functions

`history/repository.ts` owns reads, adds, updates, and the shared mutation lock.
`history/database.ts` owns IndexedDB migration, paging, and retention. `history/maintenance.ts` owns stale
processing cleanup and full/per-address deletion. The root facade re-exports
their functions without wrappers so existing callers retain export identity.

| Function                           | Description                               |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `getTxHistory()`                   | Compatibility/recovery compact read       |
| `getTxHistoryPage(options)`        | Get a 30-row indexed cursor page           |
| `getTxById(txId)`                  | Hydrate one row with its transfer records  |
| `addTxToHistory(tx)`               | Add new entry with "processing" status    |
| `updateTxInHistory(txId, updates)` | Update status, txHash, error, completedAt |
| `clearTxHistory()`                 | Remove all history entries                |

### Storage Details

- **Database**: IndexedDB `walletchan-history`
- **Stores**: `transactions`, `assetTransfers`
- **Retention**: 1,000 settled entries per account/network; 50 MiB overall
- **Sort order**: Newest first (by `createdAt`)

### Chrome Storage RMW Locks

Any helper that reads a `chrome.storage` array/map/object, mutates it, and
writes the full value back must serialize that key through
the stable `src/chrome/storageLock.ts` facade. `storage/lock.ts` owns the one
shared in-process queue. Use a lock key that includes the storage area and
storage key (for example `local:pendingTxRequests` or `sync:tabAccounts`) so
unrelated stores can still write in parallel while same-key read-modify-write
operations cannot clobber each other.

This applies to pending request queues (`pendingTxRequests`,
`pendingSignatureRequests`, `pendingBatchTxRequests`,
`pendingWatchAssetRequests`, `pendingAddChainRequests`,
`walletConnectPendingRequests`), account metadata (`accounts`, `tabAccounts`,
`seedGroups`), `customTokens`, `networksInfo`, `txHistory`, `bundleStatuses`,
and `pendingBridges`. Because popup pages and the background are separate JS
contexts, `customTokens` and `networksInfo` mutations are routed through
background messages (`addCustomToken`, `updateCustomToken`,
`removeCustomToken`; `addNetwork`, `updateNetwork`, `setNetworkHidden`,
`deleteNetwork`, `confirmAddChain`) so all writes share the service worker's
lock instance.

Durable provider results use the stable `storageResultWaiter.ts` facade over
`storage/resultWaiter.ts`. The listener reads `chrome.storage.local`, removes
the exact result key after settlement, and retries an expiry handshake only for
bounded non-prompt operations. Every user-review request passes a null timeout
and remains subscribed until an explicit confirm, reject, authorization
revocation, session termination, account removal, or reset path publishes a
durable result. Bounded read-only operations retain their ordinary
`Request timed out` error.

### UI Component

`src/components/TxStatusList.tsx` displays the transaction history:

- **Default view**: 5 most recent transactions
- **Expandable**: Show/hide older transactions
- **Empty state**: "No recent transactions" message
- **Account filtering**: Only shows transactions from the currently selected account (filtered by `tx.from` address)

Each transaction card shows:

- Origin favicon and hostname (or function name if available)
- Chain badge with icon
- Status badge:
  - **Processing**: Blue badge with spinner
  - **Confirmed**: Green badge with checkmark, explorer link
  - **Failed**: Red badge with warning icon, error message
- Relative timestamp ("Just now", "5m ago", "2h ago")

**Clickable detail**: Clicking a completed transaction card opens `TxDetailModal`, which shows:

- Status badge, chain info, and explorer link
- Function name (if decoded)
- From/To addresses with `AddressParam` (ENS/Basename/WNS/GNS/Mega resolution, labels, copy + explorer links)
- Value in ETH
- Gas fee breakdown: total fee, gas price (Gwei), gas limit & usage with percentage
- **OP Stack L2 breakdown** (Base, Unichain): separate L2 fees, L1 fees, L1 gas price, L1 gas used
- Calldata decoder (reuses `CalldataDecoder` component)
- Contract deployment detection
- Error display for failed transactions

### Real-time Updates

The component listens for `txHistoryUpdated` messages to refresh automatically:

```typescript
chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((message) => {
  if (message.type === "txHistoryUpdated") {
    chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ type: "getTxHistory" }, (result) => {
      setHistory(result || []);
    });
  }
});
```

### Clear History

Users can clear transaction history via Settings:

- Navigate to Settings → "Clear Transaction History"
- Confirmation modal prevents accidental deletion
- Message: "This will permanently delete all transaction records. This action cannot be undone."

## ERC-5792 Bundle Status Storage

ERC-5792 orchestration continues to enter through the stable
`batchTxHandlers.ts` import path. Deterministic ERC-7821 encoding is isolated in
`batch/batchTxEncoding.ts`, including native-value canonicalization, exact plain-mode
calldata construction, contract-creation rejection, the payload-bearing EOA
self-call recursion guard, and EIP-7702 outer-value omission. The module has no
wallet state or side effects; the compatibility facade re-exports its original
function identities so UI, Bankr, local-signing, cross-dapp, and force-inclusion
callers remain unchanged.
Pending bundle rejection/call editing and origin-scoped status lookup/explorer
opening are isolated in `batch/batchRequestStatusHandlers.ts`; it operates on the
existing `pendingBatchTxRequests`, `bundleStatuses`, and durable result records
without changing any storage shape.
`batch/batchRequestIntake.ts` owns the injected and WalletConnect
`wallet_sendCalls` queue operation. It acknowledges the bundle id only after
both the pending request and initial bundle status are durable and the pinned
transport authorization is still current; failures remove either partial
record before publishing the exact error acknowledgement.
Atomic PK/seed execution is isolated in `batch/batchAtomic7702Execution.ts`:
it performs delegate revalidation, optional guarded EIP-7702 authorization,
the single signed ERC-7821 broadcast, and receipt/status publication while
`batchLocalCoordinator.ts` supplies the final pinned-request authorization and
completion callbacks. `batchCapabilities.ts` owns exact-address capability
advertisement; `batchSingleExecution.ts` owns the one-call shortcut;
`batchCompletionTracking.ts` mirrors terminal transaction history to bundle
status. `batchTxHandlers.ts` remains export-only.

User-assembled multi-origin batches enter through the export-only
`crossDappBatchHandlers.ts` facade and live under `crossDappBatch/`.
`storage.ts` preserves the single `crossDappBatch` key and released entry
schema. `intake.ts` persists a pinned transaction or complete
`wallet_sendCalls` sibling group before removing its source prompt;
`staging.ts` routes edit/remove/reject outcomes by source kind.
`lifecycle.ts` groups distinct sources, captures injected/WalletConnect epochs,
and removes unauthorized staging before terminal publication.
`confirmation.ts` acquires duplicate-confirm exclusion before asynchronous
reads, validates the stored account/from/chain lock, encodes the reviewed calls,
and composes either `bankr.ts` or `local.ts`. Both signer paths re-resolve the
exact account and perform the final transport/epoch commit at their irreversible
effect boundary. Token-funded confirmation instead composes
`feePayment.ts`/`feePaymentCompletion.ts`: the former owns exact quote
consumption and sign-once submission, while the latter requires verified
EntryPoint finality. `resultRoute.ts` retains only bounded public source IDs so
restart recovery can fan out the real transaction hash. `completion.ts` fans
one shared hash or failure to transaction results and ERC-5792 bundle statuses
independently and owns delayed receipt mirroring.

`bundleStatuses` is stored as a single array in `chrome.storage.local` and is
read by `wallet_getCallsStatus`. The stable `bundleStatusStorage.ts` facade
delegates to `batch/bundleStatusStorage.ts`, which serializes
`saveBundleStatus`, `updateBundleStatus`, and cleanup writes with an in-process
lock so concurrent read-modify-write operations cannot clobber each other. This
is required for cross-dapp batches where one confirmed onchain transaction fans
out terminal status updates to multiple source `wallet_sendCalls` bundle IDs.

## Token Holdings & Transfers

### Portfolio API

Token holdings are fetched via a provider-agnostic website API route:

- **Website route**: `apps/website/app/api/portfolio/route.ts` (GET `/api/portfolio?address=0x...`)
- **Extension client**: `portfolio/api.ts` fetches from `https://walletchan.eth.sh/api/portfolio`
- **Response format**: Provider-agnostic `PortfolioResponse` with bounded
  `tokens[]`/`defiPositions[]`, complete `totalValueUsd`, and truncation metadata
  (`tokenCount`, `omittedTokenCount`, `omittedTokenValueUsd`, and per-chain
  omitted value)
- **Provider order**: Zerion primary, Dune SIM temporary fallback, Alchemy final token-only fallback

Zerion is queried without `filter[chain_ids]` so balances and DeFi positions on
new Zerion-supported EVM chains can appear without changing the WalletChan API.
The provider resolves Zerion string chain IDs to numeric EVM chain IDs using the
Zerion `/v1/chains/` endpoint plus static fallbacks for known slugs; positions
that cannot be represented as a numeric EVM `chainId` are skipped because the
public `PortfolioResponse` contract uses numeric chain IDs.

The website sorts provider wallet tokens by value and returns at most 1,000
tokens, 100 DeFi positions, and 50 assets/rewards per position. The complete
provider total and omitted token value remain in the response, so limiting dust
does not understate the portfolio header or per-chain totals. The extension
independently enforces a 4 MiB transport ceiling, validates/caps strings, URLs,
numbers, addresses, token/position arrays, and rejects more than 20,000 raw
token candidates before any response can enter React state. Legacy uncapped
responses are reduced to the same 1,000-token value-ranked working set; native
assets receive a bounded preservation pass. This resource policy remains
internal; portfolio screens do not describe response truncation to users.

Screens that need only an aggregate use the `summary=1` response projection.
Send and Swap keep at most 200 ranked portfolio assets in React/RPC working
state, while pinning native assets, custom assets, recent receipts, and an
explicitly selected asset. Token-management screens use a 300-asset working
set. Shared token pickers and hidden-token management mount/cache logos for 60
rows at a time and advance with normal pagination. Swap and bridge remote token
catalogs are independently validated and capped at 2,000 entries with 2 MiB
transport ceilings.

### Onchain Balance Verification

API portfolio data is shown immediately, while onchain balances are verified in the background via `portfolio/onchainBalances.ts`:

- **Multicall3** (`0xcA11bde05977b3631167028862bE2a173976CA11`, same address on all chains) batches native `getEthBalance` and ERC20 `balanceOf` calls into a single multicall per chain. Registry entries with `hasNativeToken: false` are excluded before RPC work; Tempo uses this policy because its `eth_getBalance` response is a compatibility sentinel, not a user-owned asset. Tempo's USD/6 EVM currency metadata remains available to fee and transaction renderers; only balance-bearing/selectable native-token paths are disabled.
- Calls are chunked into batches of 100 to avoid oversized RPC requests
- Execution is capped at four chains concurrently, with an 8s timeout and no
  retries, so an all-network whale portfolio cannot create an RPC burst across
  every configured chain
- Cached viem clients per chainId for performance
- Falls back to API values on any error (per-token or per-batch)
- A failed token read does not by itself label the chain RPC unhealthy. The
  home warning is eligible only when every attempted balance read for a chain
  fails and a final `eth_blockNumber` health probe also fails.
- `fetchOnchainBalances(..., { preserveZeroBalanceTokens: true })` keeps zero-balance entries within a selector's bounded working projection instead of dropping them after verification

### Shared Portfolio Token Catalog

`portfolio/tokenCatalog.ts` is the single source of truth for wallet token lists shown across the extension. It builds a shared catalog consumed by `TokenHoldings`, `TokenTransfer`, and `SwapView` by merging:

- Portfolio API tokens
- User-added custom ERC-20 tokens from `chrome.storage.local.customTokens`
- Recently received ERC-20 stubs from `chrome.storage.local.recentlyReceivedTokens`
- Native token placeholders for visible chains whose registry policy permits a real native token
- On upgrade, a v3.19 user-added Tempo record is canonicalized into the built-in `Tempo` entry by chain ID. Its RPC override and hidden/visible preference survive, while stale custom explorer/native-currency metadata is replaced by the registry policy. If the user renamed the custom record, its active-chain selection is migrated to the canonical `Tempo` name in the same locked storage update. The generated add-network catalog excludes Tempo mainnet so it cannot reintroduce the released ETH/18 metadata.
- CoinGecko USD price fallback for custom-chain native tokens when the portfolio API has no price (for example `MON` on Monad)
- ERC-20 metadata fallback via `tokenMetadata.ts` so recently received/custom tokens can reuse the same logo/name source as Swap/Bridge selectors
- The CoinGecko fallback runs through the background `portfolio/coingecko.ts` facade, which shares rate-limit/cache state across focused native and ERC-20 services and persists market/search caches in `chrome.storage.local` so reopening the popup doesn't cold-start CoinGecko traffic each time
- `TokenHoldings` first calls the catalog with enrichment disabled so Portfolio
  API data and the complete provider total render immediately. Expensive work is
  progressive and bounded to 24 rows: the initial page prioritizes explicitly
  refreshed/recent assets and native assets, while later pages run live balance
  verification, missing metadata/native-price enrichment, and safe image-cache
  requests only as the list approaches them during scrolling. Page enrichment
  operates on the existing catalog slice and never refetches the complete
  portfolio response. Holdings deliberately skips ERC-20 price fallback during
  enrichment to avoid fan-out/rate limits from token-price APIs; it keeps
  Portfolio API prices until the portfolio backend indexes newer values.
- Fresh popup/sidepanel mounts hydrate asynchronously from the reset-aware
  `chrome.storage.local.portfolioHoldingsCache` before the live fetch starts.
  Cache V3 is keyed by address plus the visible-chain reload key, capped to four
  entries, limited to 4 MiB total and 1,000 tokens per entry, TTL-pruned after
  24 hours, and treated as optional display data. V3 invalidates older unbounded
  snapshots. The renderer mirror uses the same four-entry LRU boundary. Older
  `walletchan:portfolioHoldingsCache:v1` DOM-localStorage mirrors are purged and
  never read, preventing a replacement wallet from inheriting prior
  addresses/balances/token imagery. Missing/invalid entries fall back to the
  normal live portfolio load.
- Account/network reloads abort the previous portfolio HTTP request. Aborted
  provider work is not converted into the native-only API fallback and cannot
  publish stale state after account selection changes.
- Portfolio balance RPC clients recheck current network visibility before use,
  including cached clients, queued chain work, fallbacks, and health probes.
  Hidden networks are skipped; already-dispatched requests may finish. The home
  alert removes hidden/deleted chains immediately and ignores their late reports.
  Explicit chain-bound operations retain their existing RPC access.
- Cached RPC issue IDs are display metadata only and are not replayed into the
  home warning. Live issue reports wait three seconds before rendering, so a
  normal cache-to-live refresh or short-lived RPC failure clears without a
  distracting banner flash. Repeated identical reports preserve both the
  original reveal deadline and an in-renderer dismissal.

After the merged catalog is built, `portfolio/tokenCatalog.ts` filters global hidden tokens from `chrome.storage.local.hiddenPortfolioTokens` before calculating `totalValueUsd`. This keeps Holdings, Send, Swap holdings, current totals, and newly-written balance snapshots aligned across every wallet address. Recently received token keys are returned alongside the catalog so Holdings can still RPC-refresh those tokens immediately even if their current USD value would normally place them in the collapsed low-value group. `AddTokenModal` removes a matching hidden entry before adding a token; if the Portfolio API already returned that token, no custom token record is created.

Send, Swap, Hide Tokens, ERC-7715 asset lookup, and snapshot refresh request the
catalog without whole-list enrichment. Exact selected-token balance/price
fallbacks remain available, while broad metadata, pricing, and onchain balance
fan-out is reserved for Holdings' visible-page refresh.

Users can hide tokens from the Holdings row overflow menu or from More → Hide Tokens. The More screen reuses the shared portfolio catalog and onchain balance verification, lets users select multiple visible ERC-20 tokens, and writes them to the global hidden-token list in one batch. Its Currently Hidden sub-screen lists hidden tokens across all accounts and can show a token again globally. Bulk hide/show paths force-record a visibility-adjusted current snapshot without deleting existing chart history, then refresh the Holdings tab/chart.

This prevents the send/swap/holdings views from drifting when custom tokens, custom chains, or hidden-token preferences are added.

### Shared Chain Icon Resolution

`lib/chainIcons.ts` is the single source of truth for chain icon rendering across the extension. `ChainIcon.tsx` consumes it everywhere instead of screens reading `config.icon` directly.

Resolution order:

- Built-in registry icon from `CHAIN_REGISTRY`
- Static alias map for common user-added chains and testnets (for example Base Sepolia reuses the Base icon)
- Testnet overlay label on top of the base icon (`SEP`, `FUJI`, `T`)
- Deterministic initials fallback with stable Bauhaus colors for unknown custom chains

Important constraints:

- No chain icons are stored in `chrome.storage`; icon rendering is fully derived from chain ID + chain name
- Known testnets should reuse the mainnet icon with an overlay instead of adding a separate storage concept
- Chain logos that need a contrast surface declare optional theme-aware `logoStyle` metadata on their `CHAIN_REGISTRY` entry. Each light/dark scheme owns its `surface`, `border`, and `insetOutline`; dark themes fall back to the light scheme when no dark override exists. `resolveChainIconMeta` carries the complete treatment to every registered testnet parent mapping, and `ChainIcon` applies the active scheme without requiring a caller-specific chip flag.
- Any new UI that needs a chain icon should render `ChainIcon`, not `config.icon` directly

### TokenHoldings Component

- Shows token list with symbol, balance, USD value, chain badge
- The portfolio network filter starts linked to the active connected dapp's chain. Portfolio options → Follow dapp network disables or re-enables that behavior for both Assets and Activity; disabling immediately shows all networks, while enabling immediately applies the current dapp chain. The default-on preference is persisted in `chrome.storage.sync.followDappNetwork`. While enabled, a manual chain or "All networks" selection detaches the link until a later chain switch requested by that dapp or from the connected-site bottom dock explicitly relinks it. The background emits the verified internal `portfolioDappChainChanged` event after authorizing a provider switch notification; tab IDs prevent a switch in another tab from relinking the active tab's filter.
- Hover actions include Swap, Send, custom-token Edit, and an overflow menu for hiding ERC-20 tokens
- Hiding a token stores a global hidden-token entry, removes it from totals, clears cached holdings, and force-appends a current aggregate snapshot so future chart points reflect the hidden-token view without deleting existing chart history
- Total portfolio value header with hide/show toggle (persisted in `chrome.storage.sync.hidePortfolioValue`)
- Canonical ETH, USDC, and USDT balances are unified across networks by
  default. The checkmarked Portfolio options → Unify Balances row toggles the
  grouped presentation and dismisses the sheet so the result is immediately
  visible; disabling it renders every chain/token entry separately. The
  preference is persisted in `chrome.storage.sync.unifyPortfolioBalances`, and
  missing or malformed values resolve to `true` for released installs.
- 60-second client-side cache plus a best-effort local `portfolioHoldingsCache` for first paint after popup/sidepanel reopen
- Large asset/position collections mount in 24-row pages. An
  `IntersectionObserver` rooted at the WalletChan screen scroll owner advances
  the page with a 240px look-ahead; its visible load-more control remains a
  keyboard-accessible fallback. Search, chain, account, tab, balance-unification,
  and low-value disclosure changes reset the page boundary. Only rendered token
  rows participate in RPC verification and remote-logo raster caching.
  Scroll-driven cache persistence is coalesced for 750ms and chart snapshot
  recording for one second so rapid page advances do not serialize the complete
  catalog or touch extension storage once per page.
- Collapsed low-value rows are excluded from routine RPC verification.
  Expanding them verifies only the rendered 24-row page. Receipt-derived token
  keys remain the narrow exception and are prioritized after confirmation so a
  newly received token updates even while its low-value group is collapsed. A
  failed visible-token RPC read is attempted once per refresh cycle; it remains
  eligible for the next manual, full, or receipt-driven refresh instead of
  immediately rescheduling itself and continuously replacing portfolio state.
- Public chart hover/NumberFlow state is isolated in
  `Portfolio/PortfolioBalanceChart.tsx`, so pointer movement cannot rerender
  Holdings or Activity. A same-address snapshot refresh retains the existing
  chart, and a deduplicated hourly snapshot write does not trigger a chart read.
  The first unresolved load for a new address remains the only public-chart
  skeleton path.
- Refresh icon beside the portfolio privacy control, loading skeletons, empty state
- Click token → opens TokenTransfer view

### Portfolio Snapshot Storage

`portfolio/snapshotStorage.ts` silently records `totalValueUsd` snapshots per address over time in `chrome.storage.local` under the key `portfolioSnapshotsV2`. The legacy `portfolioSnapshots` key is removed on read/write because its aggregate-only records cannot be repaired after the Tempo native-balance sentinel bug. Forced visibility refreshes use the catalog's complete aggregate directly and do not re-query every token balance before `snapshotStorage`.

**How it works:**

- `recordSnapshot(address, totalValueUsd, options?)` is called from `TokenHoldings.tsx` after each portfolio load (preferring onchain enhanced value, falling back to API-only)
- Hidden-token visibility changes call `recordSnapshot(..., { force: true })` to append the current visible total immediately while preserving prior chart history
- Snapshots are deduplicated by default: skipped if the last snapshot for the address is <1 hour old unless `force` is set
- Entries older than 8 days are pruned on each write
- Addresses are normalized to lowercase

**Storage shape:**

```typescript
// chrome.storage.local key: "portfolioSnapshotsV2"
{ [address: string]: { timestamp: number; totalValueUsd: number }[] }
```

**Exports:**

- `recordSnapshot(address, totalValueUsd, options?)` — append snapshot (with dedup + prune, or forced append)
- `getSnapshots(address)` — read all snapshots for an address

**Future expansion:**

- **7-day holdings chart**: Use `getSnapshots()` to render a sparkline or area chart on the portfolio view showing value over the past week
- **Per-token snapshots**: Extend the snapshot shape to include per-token breakdowns (`{ symbol, valueUsd }[]`) for individual token performance charts
- **Snapshot on background alarm**: Register a `chrome.alarms` periodic task (e.g., every 4 hours) that fetches portfolio in the background service worker and records a snapshot, so data is captured even when the popup isn't opened
- **Export/analytics**: Expose snapshot data for CSV export or aggregate statistics (daily high/low, % change)

### Token Transfer Flow

Send checks resolved recipients locally for possible address poisoning. The
Send-only `useSendRecipientSafety` hook calls the wallet-UI-only
`getSendRecipientReferences` route, which returns saved contact labels/addresses
and actual payees from successful, hash-bearing local Send history. References
span retained accounts and chains; incoming transfers and receipt counterparties
never populate the list. The read scans at most 10,000 recent rows and returns
at most 1,500 unique references, with contacts first. No network request or new
storage key is introduced. Clearing/evicting history or removing contacts also
removes their references.

`history/recordCodec.ts` captures additive `sendRecipient` metadata before
discarding settled calldata. The pure policy accepts native sends and canonical
ERC-20 transfer payees from explicit Send entries, plus coordinator-authored
sponsored recipient metadata; approvals, arbitrary calldata, impersonators,
cancellations, swaps, bridges and batch/executor rows are excluded. Released
compact rows can contribute only when their local native/transfer snapshot
agrees with the recorded target and selector. Missing evidence is not guessed
from `tx.to` or receipt logs. Processing, pending and failed rows never enter
the comparison list, even when they retain recipient metadata.

The renderer compares valid EVM addresses case-insensitively, excludes exact
matches and `0x`, and flags at least eight matching characters combined at the
two ends (including asymmetric matches). A collapsed notice above the sticky Send
actions expands to show the comparison and acknowledgement; Review send carries
a warning icon while this check blocks it. It shows full checksummed addresses
with differing characters underlined and requires an explicit full-address
acknowledgement before Review send. Recipient, sender, chain or reference
changes reset acknowledgement; stale asynchronous reads are ignored. Loading
and unavailable checks disable proceeding, with Retry for failures. The
sponsored-send fallback shares this gate. Contract deployments are exempt.
This protection is mounted only in Send: dapp, WalletConnect, batch, Safe
confirmation and Unshield screens keep their existing behavior. The warning
also appears when entering Send with a Safe account, but does not alter Safe
proposal approval/execution or infer payees from its outer execution history.

#### Address Contact Book

More → Address book manages the optional local-only `addressContacts` list.
The trusted-UI `contactBookRouter.ts` exposes bounded create, label-update,
delete, and exact-permutation reorder operations; mutations broadcast
`addressContactsUpdated`, and wallet reset removes the key. Address display
priority is user contact, WalletChan account display name, cached reverse name,
eth.sh label, then a middle-truncated address. The shared eth.sh client checks
the contact repository before egress, so a saved contact never triggers the
public label endpoint. The add-contact dialog accepts either a raw EVM address
or any name supported by the shared forward resolver (ENS, Basenames, `.wei`,
`.gwei`, and `.mega`). It displays the resolved address before submission and
persists only that normalized address in the contact record. A successfully
entered service name also seeds the public `ensIdentityCache` as a partial
identity so the Address book can skip reverse resolution and batch only its
avatar lookup.

Address book enrichment uses the shared six-hour identity cache. Cache misses
are reverse-resolved in Multicall3 batches per chain across ENS, Basenames,
WNS/GNS, and MegaNames; winning-name avatar records are then fetched in batched
contract reads where the service supports them. The contact label remains the
primary text, the public primary name replaces the truncated secondary address,
and a safely rasterized cached avatar replaces the blockie when available.
Address Book and Send consume the same `useAddressContactIdentities` projection
and `AddressContactAvatar` renderer, which keeps public-name text, safe avatars,
and deterministic blockie fallback synchronized across both lists.
They also mount the same `AddressContactList` for row presentation, label edits,
deletion confirmation, and pointer/touch/keyboard ordering. Send supplies its
eligible contact subset to that component; the shared pure order model replaces
only those contacts' slots in the complete saved order before calling the
background exact-permutation route. Contacts hidden because they duplicate a
wallet account therefore retain their stored position. Active search filters
disable reordering while edit, delete, and selection remain available.

Send exposes My contacts with canonical WalletChan accounts first and saved
contacts second. Recipient typing uses a keyboard-operable local combobox over
wallet names, contact labels, cached public primary names, and addresses. Its
suggestion rows reuse the same safe onchain avatar, deterministic blockie, and
public-name secondary text as the full contact picker; selection still supplies
the exact raw address to the existing recipient validation, contract detection,
pending transaction intake, and Bankr/private-key/seed-phrase signing paths.
An exact address already present in eligible contacts or wallet accounts uses
that local identity immediately and passes an empty input to the remote name
resolver, so picker/autocomplete selections never flash “Resolving…” or issue a
redundant reverse-name/avatar request. Manual unknown addresses and typed names
retain the normal resolver path; contract-address detection still runs for both.

1. User clicks a token in TokenHoldings
2. App.tsx switches to `"transfer"` view with selected token state
3. TokenTransfer form: recipient address input, amount input with MAX button
   - Native-token sends can include optional hex calldata. The send form shows
     a **Decode Calldata** modal for valid non-deploy native calldata once the
     recipient resolves. The modal reuses `ClearSigningView` against
     `{ chainId, recipient, calldata }` and `CalldataDecoder`; the decoder is
     collapsed by default when clear signing renders.
4. On submit, `buildTransferTx()` creates calldata:
   - **Native**: `{ to, value: parseEther(amount), data: "0x" }` or the
     user-provided hex calldata
   - **ERC20**: `{ to: contractAddress, data: encodeFunctionData("transfer", [to, amount]), value: "0x0" }`
5. Sends `initiateTransfer` message to background
6. Background creates a `PendingTxRequest` with origin "WalletChan"
7. Normal TransactionConfirmation flow takes over

The Base USDC sponsored-send feature gate is currently disabled in
`Transfer/model/sponsoredTransferPolicy.ts`. Base USDC therefore follows the
same standard ERC-20 `initiateTransfer` path as other ERC-20 tokens for Bankr,
private-key, and seed-phrase accounts, and the Send UI does not request premium
status or show sponsorship messaging. When enabled, eligible premium Base USDC
sends may use the sponsored ERC-3009 path instead. The background validates and
pins the account/from/to/
amount, signs one `TransferWithAuthorization`, encrypts the exact relay payload
with the general vault key, and stores it in bounded
`sponsoredTransferIntents` recovery state before starting the relay request.
If the relay result is ambiguous, WalletChan does not submit again or offer a
normal ERC-20 fallback. A status check decrypts the original nonce and asks two
fixed Base RPCs for the USDC authorization state at each endpoint's exact
finalized block. Only agreement that the nonce was consumed completes the
history item; only agreement that it was unused after `validBefore` permits a
new authorization. RPC failure/disagreement and malformed recovery state stay
fail-closed. Submitted/consumed records remain semantic dedupe markers until
the trusted renderer acknowledges the returned stored intent ID, covering a
popup that closes after the background commits but before it receives success.
Unacknowledged records block account removal/reset and are never pruned by
renderer wall time.

### Calldata Decoder

Transaction calldata is decoded using the eth.sh API:

- **API**: POST `https://eth.sh/api/calldata/decoder-recursive` with `{ calldata, address, chainId }`
- **Component**: `CalldataDecoder.tsx` with Decoded/Raw tab toggle
- **Native send preview**: `NativeCalldataDecodeModal.tsx` composes
  `ClearSigningView` + `CalldataDecoder` from the send form before the pending
  tx is created. It is hidden while the same native calldata is marked as a
  contract deployment because deployment bytecode has no recipient contract to
  resolve clear signing or ABI decoding against.
- **Parameter display**: Color-coded by type (addresses=blue with labels, numbers=gold, bools=green/red, bytes=muted)
- **Fallback**: Raw hex if decode fails or for contract deployments (no `to` address)

### Block Explorer Transaction Decoder

The all-sites `inject.js` content script recognizes top-frame `/tx/<hash>`
paths, resolves the source against the normalized built-in/custom network
registry, and inserts a style-isolated tab selector at the start of the
explorer's native Input Data value column. The WalletChan tab includes the
wallet mark, is selected by default, and replaces the native panes while
selected. Its iframe uses a left-aligned 52% technical reading column up to 880px,
then returns to full width below 900px. The site-derived tab label (`Etherscan`,
`BaseScan`, and so on) restores the explorer's exact raw/decoded input panes
and controls when selected.

Settings shows an **Enhance Block Explorers** destination immediately after
Security. Its dedicated screen owns a default-on switch. The synced
`explorerEnhancementsEnabled` preference treats only
the exact boolean `false` as disabled. Content scripts read it before resolving
an explorer page, observe changes live, and remove an existing embed when it is
turned off; while disabled they perform no explorer resolution, iframe creation,
or transaction RPC work.

Because WalletChan is the initial view, `explorer.html` is created during the
recognized transaction-page mount and begins the configured transaction RPC,
clear-signing descriptor, token-metadata, and calldata-decoder work. The iframe
starts at its compact loading height and reports the intrinsic React-root
height through the explorer-only background relay. Returning to WalletChan
after viewing the site tab reuses the already resolved iframe rather than
repeating initial RPC work.

The content script observes DOM changes and also polls the current URL at a
low frequency, so History API navigation from an address/search page into a
transaction works even when the explorer does not emit `popstate`, `hashchange`,
or a useful DOM mutation at the URL boundary. A recognized transaction waits
for the native Input Data container rather than falling back to the top of the
page. Late or replaced transaction markup is detected, detached controls are
remounted, and native content plus frame-message listeners are restored or
removed during navigation.

`components/ExplorerTransaction/` resolves the explorer to `{ chainId, rpcUrl }`,
checks `eth_chainId`, fetches the exact `eth_getTransactionByHash` record, and
requires the returned hash and bounded transaction fields to match before
rendering. The panel reuses `ClearSigningView` and `CalldataDecoder`, supports
loading/error/retry states, and treats empty calldata and contract creation
explicitly. ERC-7821 self-batches take the same `decodeErc7821Batch` → shared
`BatchCallsSummary` path as Activity transaction details, replacing the opaque
outer `execute` action and calldata with individually labeled, collapsible
inner calls. The explorer projection suppresses each call's calldata digest
because the adjacent native explorer tab already owns raw-data verification;
Activity and confirmation consumers retain the digest. Across all three
surfaces, an expanded call is the sole bordered surface owner; its nested
decoded/raw calldata view uses the shared flat variant without another card
edge. Ordinary transactions lead with the same heading-free
Action/Payment summary adapted from transaction details. The decoded
function name updates that summary even when no clear-signing descriptor
matches. When clear signing resolves, its verified parameters render inside
that same surface directly after Action and before Payment. The explorer's
existing transaction context remains the contract authority, so the embed does
not repeat a Contract row. Decoded/raw calldata starts expanded in a separate,
collapsible technical surface. No transaction,
signature, or account operation is available from this read-only surface.

Because `explorer.html` is an embedded, web-accessible extension document, it
is not a trusted wallet UI. `chrome/explorerTransaction/messageRouter.ts` is a
pre-audience, public-metadata-only exception for the exact explorer document.
It re-resolves Chrome-attested `sender.tab.url` against configured explorers
and requires the
message chain ID to match before allowing only calldata descriptor lookup or
public token metadata, plus the token-bound resize/dismiss relay carrying no
transaction data. All wallet, account, auth, history, and signing routes
continue to fail the main audience gate.

### Clear Signing Descriptors

`ClearSigningView` renders ERC-7730-style descriptors for transaction calldata
and EIP-712 messages before the raw decoder/typed-data panel. Descriptor
resolution is remote-first, local-second:

- `chrome/clearSigningHandlers.ts` is the stable facade over the focused
  `chrome/clearSigning/` audit domain. `descriptorCache.ts` owns the exact v3
  key/schema and 7-day hit / 1-day miss TTL; `descriptorClient.ts` owns the
  10-second, 512 KiB bounded public request; `descriptorResolver.ts` owns the
  configured-RPC proxy fallback and immutable deployment extension; and
  `handlers.ts` coordinates opt-out, validation, cache, and resolution.
- `lib/clearSigning/builtinDescriptors.ts` is the local descriptor registry.
  It contains generic selector descriptors (ERC-20 transfer/approve, Safe
  MultiSend) and address-bound custom descriptors (GNS NameNFT,
  SubdomainRegistrar, HumanRegistrar, Multicall3). Address-bound descriptors
  must match both chain ID and deployed contract address before rendering.
- `getBuiltinCalldataDescriptor()` is the single local fallback used by the UI
  and by history snapshots. Add future custom local clear-signing coverage
  there so confirmation screens, nested calls, and Activity metadata stay in
  sync.
- GNS descriptors render `tokenId` / `parentId` fields with the custom
  `gweiName` value format. `ClearSigningView` resolves those IDs through
  `NameNFT.getFullName(tokenId)` and displays the `.gwei` domain, falling back
  to a compact token ID only if the name cannot be resolved.
- GNS `setContenthash` renders the `hash` bytes as a `Website` field using the
  custom `contentHash` value format. The pure formatter in
  `lib/clearSigning/contentHashFormat.ts` decodes EIP-1577 contenthash bytes
  into URI-style text such as `ipfs://...` or `ipns://...`, falling back to raw
  bytes if a malformed or future codec cannot be decoded.
- `isGenericBuiltinCalldataCall()` is intentionally narrower than
  `getBuiltinCalldataDescriptor()`: it only identifies selector-generic calls
  for batch UI de-duplication. Custom address-bound descriptors are not treated
  as generic, which prevents selector collisions like ERC-721
  `approve(address,uint256)` being displayed as an ERC-20 allowance.
- `chrome/clearSignedMetaSnapshot.ts` is the stable facade over the snapshot
  builders and fire-and-forget history attachment in `chrome/clearSigning/`.
  Approve, transfer, native-send, and ERC-7730 metadata retain that priority.
  Asset snapshot builders persist `tokenDecimals` alongside the formatted
  amount so compact Activity formatting never has to infer ERC-20 precision.
  If the remote registry misses or has no matching format, the ERC-7730 builder
  falls back to the local registry before recording `clearSignedMeta`; builder
  or history-write failures remain optional and never delay transaction flow.

### Typed Data Display

EIP-712 typed data signatures show structured display:

- **Primary content**: primary type plus recursive message fields for nested
  objects/arrays
- **Address tools**: eth.sh labels use the shared transaction-style
  `LabeledAddressPopover`; unlabeled addresses use shared copy/explorer actions
- **Advanced details**: domain, types, exact raw typed data, and EIP-712 hashes
- `personal_sign` shows safe decoded text first; invalid UTF-8, control-heavy,
  `eth_sign`, and otherwise unreadable payloads display a warning and keep exact
  bytes in Advanced details

### ERC-7710 / ERC-7715 Delegated Permissions

Raw ERC-7710 delegation typed data is not a dapp signing surface.
`eip712Validator.ts` rejects external `eth_signTypedData_v3` /
`eth_signTypedData_v4` requests whose primary type and fields match the
Delegation Framework `Delegation` schema, and `txHandlers.ts` repeats the check
at confirm time for persisted legacy requests.

Dapps must use ERC-7715 provider methods:

- `wallet_getSupportedExecutionPermissions`: returns WalletChan's fixed
  supported permission types and chain IDs that have a known default 7702
  DeleGator deployment.
- `wallet_getGrantedExecutionPermissions`: returns active, non-expired grants
  scoped to the requesting origin, active account, and chain.
- `wallet_requestExecutionPermissions`: is routed through
  `erc7715PermissionHandlers.ts`. It runs preflight in
  the stable `erc7715/preflight.ts` facade: local signer account only, valid ERC-7715
  request shape, fixed permission/rule allowlist from
  the stable `erc7715/registry.ts` facade, `from` matching the active account, supported
  chain, configured RPC URL, and live `eth_getCode(activeEOA)` showing
  WalletChan's default Stateless DeleGator. If preflight passes, the request is
  stored in `pendingErc7715PermissionRequests`, shown in
  `Erc7715PermissionConfirmation.tsx`, and resolved after user approval or
  rejection. Permission prompts have no age-based timeout. Final approval,
  rejection, or explicit authorization/session invalidation results are written to
  `erc7715PermissionResult:{id}` so injected and WalletConnect callers do not
  depend on a long-lived MV3 `sendMessage` response channel.

While a `wallet_requestExecutionPermissions` request is in progress,
WalletChan blocks additional external dapp requests with the same
standard in-process error. The injected provider holds an inpage lock so
locally answered methods like `eth_chainId` cannot bypass the block, and the
background router enforces the same lock for injected transaction, signature,
batch, RPC proxy, capabilities/status, watch-asset, add-chain, and execution
permission requests. The lock is also derived from all valid pending
`pendingErc7715PermissionRequests`, so it survives MV3 service-worker restarts;
until that storage-backed state is loaded, external provider RPCs fail closed.
The enqueue path synchronizes the derived storage lock from the saved pending
request list before releasing the temporary in-memory lock, avoiding an
enqueue-to-storage-change window where another external request could slip in.
The WalletConnect router also checks `erc7715/requestLock.ts` before
processing session requests.

Current permission vocabulary is deliberately narrow:

- `native-token-allowance`: `data.allowanceAmount`, optional
  `data.startTime`
- `native-token-periodic`: `data.periodAmount`, `data.periodDuration`,
  optional `data.startTime`
- `native-token-stream`: optional `data.initialAmount`, optional
  `data.maxAmount`, `data.amountPerSecond`, optional `data.startTime`
- `erc20-token-allowance`: `data.tokenAddress`, `data.allowanceAmount`,
  optional `data.startTime`
- `erc20-token-periodic`: `data.tokenAddress`, `data.periodAmount`,
  `data.periodDuration`, optional `data.startTime`
- `erc20-token-stream`: `data.tokenAddress`, optional `data.initialAmount`,
  optional `data.maxAmount`, `data.amountPerSecond`, optional
  `data.startTime`
- `token-approval-revocation`: boolean revocation primitives
  `erc20Approve`, `erc721Approve`, `erc721SetApprovalForAll`,
  `permit2Approve`, `permit2Lockdown`, and `permit2InvalidateNonces`. The
  `permit2InvalidateNonces` flag must currently be `false`; WalletChan rejects
  broad Permit2 nonce invalidation until a later phase can scope it to exact
  token/spender pairs.

The registry rejects unknown fields, `MAX_UINT256` / zero amounts for
non-stream allowances, periodic durations over ten years, malformed token
addresses, duplicate/expired `expiry` rules, and start times that are not
before expiry. All stream grants require an expiry. This keeps the exposure
time-bounded and prevents the DeleGator stream enforcers from later reverting
because their elapsed-time multiplication happens before the max-amount clamp.
EVM addresses are accepted in any valid `0x` 20-byte hex capitalization and
normalized to EIP-55 checksum form before storage, display, caveat terms, and
responses. Omitted `startTime` values follow WalletChan's Advanced Permissions
behavior and are normalized to the preflight timestamp.
Token approval revocation requires at least one revocation primitive and an
expiry, and broad Permit2 nonce invalidation is rejected because it can cancel
unrelated pending Permit2 signatures without token/spender pinning. If any
enabled Permit2 primitive is requested, preflight requires a WalletChan built-in
chain and live code at canonical Permit2
`0x000000000022D473030F116dDEE9F6B43aC78BA3` on the configured RPC.
The field names follow the Delegation Framework permission payloads so later caveat
construction and UI work can line up with the same semantics.
`permission.justification` is accepted as optional display-only metadata
(WalletChan also tolerates legacy `permission.data.justification` and
normalizes it out of `data`). It is bounded, shown to the user, persisted with
the request/response, and never used as a caveat input.

`erc7715/caveats.ts` is the stable local facade for the phase-one
permission-to-caveat mapping. Canonical addresses/types live in
`caveatDefinitions.ts`, fixed-width terms in `caveatEncoding.ts`, and the
permission switch in `caveatBuilder.ts`.
It uses the deployed DeleGator v1.3.0 `DelegationManager`, `ROOT_AUTHORITY`,
`TimestampEnforcer`, `ExactCalldataEnforcer`, `ValueLteEnforcer`,
`NativeTokenPeriodTransferEnforcer`, `NativeTokenStreamingEnforcer`,
`ERC20PeriodTransferEnforcer`, `ERC20StreamingEnforcer`,
`ApprovalRevocationEnforcer`, and `NonceEnforcer` constants and encodes terms
with the same fixed-width layouts as the installed delegation-core package.
Native-token permissions always include `ExactCalldataEnforcer(0x)` because the
native enforcers constrain `value` but not target/calldata. ERC-20 permissions
always include `ValueLteEnforcer(0)` because the ERC-20 enforcers constrain
token transfers but should not allow native value. Standard grants include a
`NonceEnforcer` term read from `currentNonce(DelegationManager, delegator)` at
preflight/confirmation so nonce invalidation can revoke them. Allowance grants
use the relevant periodic enforcer with `periodDuration = uint256.max`, which
matches the current Delegation Framework permission decoder shape. Timestamp caveats
are expiry-only for the current ERC-7715 vocabulary; start time is enforced by
the period/stream enforcer terms. Token approval revocation terms are the
DeleGator one-byte bitmask, also paired with `NonceEnforcer`.
On approval, `erc7715/delegationSigning.ts` constructs the ERC-7710 typed data
internally with `delegator = active account`, `delegate = request.to`,
`authority = ROOT_AUTHORITY`, canonical `DelegationManager`, and only the
WalletChan-derived caveats. The EIP-712 `Caveat` type intentionally contains
only `enforcer` and `terms`; `args` are not signed by ERC-7710 and are added
only to the ABI-encoded signed delegation context. The local private-key/seed
signer signs that typed data after confirmation, the signed delegation chain is
ABI-encoded as the ERC-7715 `context`, and `dependencies` is currently `[]`
because the EOA must already be EIP-7702-authorized to WalletChan's default
delegate. Grant records are stored in `erc7715PermissionGrants` with the
original request, returned response, signed delegation, typed data, caveats,
expiry, and context hash.
Dapps cannot submit arbitrary enforcer addresses through the ERC-7715 path.

Because the returned ERC-7710 context is reusable authority rather than a
one-time signature, approval is master-session-only. Password and biometric
master sessions are accepted (including signing-compatible V1 passkeys and V2
purpose-separated records); agent sessions are rejected even when the prompt
was originally queued under a master session. `delegation/authorityPolicy.ts`
(re-exported by the stable `delegatedAuthorityPolicy.ts` facade)
captures the auth epoch before key recovery/signing, and the grant storage
helper re-checks the epoch plus live master type synchronously at one atomic
storage commit that writes the grant, removes the pending prompt, and publishes
the success result. That commit is the capability-issuance linearization point,
so timed expiry, manual lock, or a master-to-agent transition cannot publish
after master authority is lost; post-commit cleanup cannot report a false
failure or leave a retryable prompt that issues a duplicate grant.

Account Settings includes a delegated-permissions management section for
private-key and seed-phrase accounts. It lists active, non-expired grants for
the selected account grouped by requesting origin, displays the chain,
permission type, delegate, token, amount/frequency, and expiry, and exposes an
onchain revoke action. Active grant reads call `eth_getCode(account)`,
`disabledDelegations(hash)`, and any stored `NonceEnforcer` term over the
configured chain RPC. If the EOA is no longer delegated to WalletChan's default
DeleGator, the delegation hash is disabled, or the stored nonce no longer
matches the current nonce, WalletChan marks the grant revoked before returning
results to Account Settings or `wallet_getGrantedExecutionPermissions`. If the
RPC cannot verify onchain delegate/disabled/nonce state, active grant reads and
onchain revoke initiation fail closed instead of returning an unverified grant
as active.
`initiateErc7715PermissionRevoke`
validates account/grant ownership, checks the stored delegation manager, encodes
the `disableDelegation((...))` call for the signed ERC-7710 delegation,
checks `disabledDelegations(hash)` through the onchain revoke path, and queues
a normal WalletChan transaction to the canonical `DelegationManager` only when
the delegation is not already disabled and no revoke tx for that grant is
already pending. The receipt poller marks the grant
`status: "revoked"` only after that tx succeeds. Queued revoke transactions
carry `erc7715PermissionRevokeMeta` with display-safe grant details
(`grantId`, original origin, permission type, delegate, token/amount/frequency,
and expiry). `TransactionConfirmation.tsx` uses that snapshot to show a
dedicated human-readable "Revoke delegated permission" summary and keeps the
generic calldata decoder collapsed for audit access instead of making
`disableDelegation((...))` the primary review surface. `TxDetailModal.tsx`
reuses the same snapshot after submission so the Activity tab shows the
delegated-permission revoke summary above the raw transaction details.

The confirmation UI composes the same Warm Midnight request primitives as
transaction, batch, and signature review. The screen uses shared top queue
navigation and Reject all, centered `RequestIdentity`, a plain-language summary
of the reusable authority, one chain-qualified permission-limits section,
delegate and site-justification rows, scroll-aware Advanced details, and the
same compact `Signing with` sticky footer with secondary Reject and amber Grant
permission actions. Origin, account, and chain are each shown once. Shared
`LabeledAddressPopover` tools own delegate, token, manager, and enforcer copy /
explorer actions. Request type, manager, WalletChan-derived caveats and terms,
and exact raw request JSON remain behind Advanced details.
`Erc7715PermissionConfirmation/Erc7715PermissionEditableControls.tsx`
lets users adjust supported permission terms before approval only when
`permission.isAdjustmentAllowed === true`. Locked requests keep amount,
frequency, start time, stream caps, and identity fields immutable. To match
WalletChan Advanced Permissions behavior, users may still add, remove, extend, or
shorten expiry on non-stream grants; stream expiry remains required and guarded
with the streaming terms because it changes total exposure. Adjustable requests
can set any positive bounded amount, change periodic frequency, move start time
later, and move an already-past start time earlier within the past. For token
approval revocation, the revocation method flags are immutable and the user can
only adjust the required expiry. Background confirmation
re-validates the edited ERC-7715 request with
`erc7715/preflight.ts`, checks it with
`lib/erc7715PermissionEditing.ts`, recomputes caveats from the edited request,
and signs only that recomputed delegation. Raw delegation/caveat details live
behind an advanced accordion for auditability. ERC-20 token amounts are not
formatted or signable with guessed decimals: if metadata lookup cannot verify a
token's decimals, the UI shows the token address and blocks amount editing /
approval until metadata is verified. The renderer feature domain is documented
in `components/Erc7715PermissionConfirmation/README.md`; root imports remain
policy-free compatibility facades.

Injected-provider calls bridge through `i_walletExecutionPermissions` in
`provider/inpage/executionPermissionAdapter.ts` and
`provider/contentBridge/executionPermissionRoute.ts`. The background route resolves the sender tab's
selected account with `getTabAccount(tabId)` before preflight/listing so an
omitted ERC-7715 `from` is scoped to the same account the dapp sees, not a
mutable global popup account. For `wallet_requestExecutionPermissions`,
the content bridge creates the pending permission id, sends it to background, and waits
on `erc7715PermissionResult:{id}` just like tx/signature result keys. The
inpage provider also rejects a second concurrent permission request immediately
with `-32002`.

WalletConnect requests use the same handler from
`walletConnect/requestRouter.ts` after session method allowlisting in
`walletConnect/sessionPolicy.ts`; the WalletConnect adapter resolves the account from
the session-authorized account set before preflight/listing so permission grants
cannot drift to the popup's currently active account. WalletConnect
`wallet_requestExecutionPermissions` requests are stored in
`walletConnectPendingRequests` with kind `erc7715Permission` and completed when
`erc7715PermissionResult:{id}` is written, so service-worker restarts do not
orphan the dapp response. The result is committed to the WalletConnect terminal
outbox before relay delivery, and the original `(topic, requestId)` claim means
a replay cannot produce a second permission grant/signature. WalletConnect grants are stored under
`walletconnect:<topic>` instead of peer-supplied URLs; peer metadata is
display-only (`senderOrigin` / favicon) because WalletConnect metadata is
self-reported.

ERC-7715 `redeemDelegations(bytes[],bytes32[],bytes[])` transactions use a
decoded asset-change preview in `txSimulation.ts` instead of the normal
bytecode-injection simulator. DelegationManager redemption can depend on the
delegator EOA's EIP-7702 smart-account code, and injecting `TxSimulator`
bytecode at that same address can create false simulated reverts. WalletChan
therefore decodes only supported single-default and batch-default executions,
nets direct native sends plus canonical `ERC20.transfer(address,uint256)` sends
against the delegator encoded in the permission context, and shows those through
the same token metadata/logo/USD enrichment pipeline as simulated transfers. Any
unsupported mode, non-zero outer DelegationManager tx value, self-transfer with
non-zero value/amount, or arbitrary calldata remains "simulation unavailable"
rather than showing a partial preview.

### Tenderly Simulation

Transaction confirmation includes a "Simulate on Tenderly" button:

- Opens `https://dashboard.tenderly.co/simulator/new` with pre-filled tx params
- No API key needed (URL-based simulation)
- Skipped for contract deployments (no `to` address)

## ENS/Basename/WNS/GNS/Mega Identity Resolution

Accounts in the dropdown automatically resolve ENS names, Basenames, WNS `.wei` names, GNS `.gwei` names, MegaNames `.mega` names, and avatars. Results are cached in `chrome.storage.local` for 6 hours.

### Network-qualified resolution

`ensUtils.ts` owns ENSIP-11 coin-type selection: Ethereum uses 60, other
supported EVM chain IDs use `0x80000000 + chainId`, and chain 0 explicitly
selects ENS's default EVM record. Resolution always starts on Ethereum L1.
The resolver supplies ENSIP-19 default-address behavior; WalletChan never
substitutes the Ethereum record when a network record is missing or fails.
Chain IDs outside the 31-bit ENSIP-11 range fail closed instead of wrapping.

Send passes its selected chain into `useAddressResolver` and clears old results
on input/network changes, including already-running asynchronous lookups.
Transaction, batch, signature, Safe, approval, typed-data, Shield, and staking
identity surfaces use their pinned network for unknown external addresses.
The shared `useEnsIdentities` hook partitions known wallet accounts and saved
contacts into Ethereum-mainnet profile lookups, preserving the same name/avatar
as the account selector even in Send, recipient pills, and Signing with.
Account and contact selectors request this profile directly. Membership updates
refresh that partition without changing forward resolution or transaction bytes.
Network-independent account lists,
onboarding, and the address book retain Ethereum mainnet profile resolution
when no network is supplied, preserving existing primary names. Explicit chain 0
still selects the new default EVM record; it is not the default API argument.
Account profiles never supply a fallback for an explicitly network-bound lookup.
Every displayed reverse-name candidate (including Basename/WNS/GNS/Mega fallbacks
and contact name hints) must forward-resolve to the same address in that scope.
The shared address pill requires an explicit chain ID from its caller.

The existing `ensIdentityCache` storage key now holds entries keyed by
`chainId:lowercaseAddress`. Legacy address-only entries are not reused. Expired
entries and unverified name hints are hidden while fresh resolution runs.
Transaction history snapshots add `counterpartyEnsChainId`; old unqualified ENS
labels are not used as verified history labels. User-authored contact/account
labels remain fixed labels for their stored addresses, not payment resolution.

### Resolution Priority

ENS (for the requested network, resolved through Ethereum mainnet) takes precedence over Basename (Base L2), which takes precedence over WNS (Wei Name Service), then GNS (Gwei Name Service), then MegaNames (MegaETH):

1. **Name**: ENS name > Basename > WNS `.wei` name > GNS `.gwei` name > MegaNames `.mega` name > truncated address
2. **Avatar**: ENS avatar (when ENS name exists) > Basename avatar (when only Basename exists) > GNS avatar text record (when only a GNS name exists) > Mega avatar (when only Mega name exists) > BankrAvatar (Bankr accounts) > BlockieAvatar (wallet-account fallback only). WNS names have no avatar support.

Normal cache misses are resolved through per-chain Multicall3 batches in
`ensBatchIdentity.ts`; explicit single-address refreshes retain the parallel
`resolveEnsIdentity()` path in `ensUtils.ts`. If ENS name exists, ENS avatar is
fetched; Basename avatar is only fetched when no ENS name is found; GNS and Mega
avatars are fetched through their `text(tokenId, "avatar")` records when their
names win resolution priority. WNS names have no avatar support. Shared request
address pills prioritize the local contact label, then a matching WalletChan
account's `displayName`, then the cached resolved name, then the caller's
contract/address label. Resolved avatars are available for wallet and external
addresses; Bankr/blockie fallbacks are restricted to addresses present in the
user's account list.

```

### Cache

- **Storage key**: `ensIdentityCache` in `chrome.storage.local`
- **TTL**: 6 hours per entry
- **Schema**: `Record<lowercaseAddress, { name, avatar, resolvedAt, needsAvatar? }>`
- **Forward-name hint**: Add contact may write `needsAvatar: true`; the next
  batch keeps that name and fetches only its avatar before clearing the flag.
- **Manual refresh**: "Refresh ENS Data" button in Account Settings forces re-resolution (ignores cache)

### Remote Image Sanitization

Identity avatars, dapp favicons, and token logos are untrusted metadata. Remote
HTTP(S) images are never rendered while a background fetch is pending; the UI
uses an inert pixel until `avatarImageCache.ts` has produced a safe raster.

- `remoteImagePolicy.ts` accepts public HTTPS on the default TLS port with no
  URL credentials. It rejects reserved/private IPv4, IPv6, IPv4-mapped IPv6,
  localhost/local hostname suffixes, `.test`, `.invalid`, and `.onion`.
- The background follows at most three redirects manually, revalidates each
  target, and omits credentials/referrers. It permits explicit raster MIME
  types; misconfigured `application/octet-stream` responses must additionally
  carry a recognized JPEG, PNG, GIF, or WebP byte signature. SVG and other
  document bytes remain rejected before decoding.
- Downloads are streamed under 2 MiB, decoded to pixels, resized to at most
  128×128, re-encoded as WebP under 512 KiB, and cached for 14 days. The cache
  is limited to 200 entries / 5 MiB and only two remote image fetches may run at
  once. `chrome.storage.local` is the only cache read by renderers; legacy
  DOM-localStorage mirrors are purged and never read.
- Decode/fetch failure stays inert and falls back to the normal letter/blockie
  treatment; it never falls back to rendering the untrusted remote URL.
- `SafeImage.tsx` is the shared renderer primitive for metadata-controlled
  images. Packaged image paths and bounded raster data are allowed directly;
  public HTTPS stays inert until the background returns re-encoded bytes.
- `tokens/nftMetadata.ts` resolves onchain tokenURI metadata under the same public
  HTTPS and manual-redirect policy. JSON is streamed under 256 KiB, inline
  data/name/description fields are bounded, and SVG/HTML image markup is
  discarded. NFT previews then use `SafeImage` rather than a raw iframe.

### RPC Configuration

`ensUtils.ts` reads user-configured RPCs from `chrome.storage.sync` (`networksInfo`), falling back to `DEFAULT_NETWORKS` defaults. This ensures ENS, WNS/GNS, and MegaNames resolution uses the same RPC endpoints configured in Settings → Chains. MegaNames uses the user's MegaETH RPC (chain 4326, default `https://mainnet.megaeth.com/rpc`). WNS/GNS resolution uses the user's Ethereum mainnet RPC and the service contracts configured in `src/utils/wei.ts`.

## RPC Proxy (CSP Bypass)

Many dapps have strict Content Security Policy that blocks connections to RPC endpoints. The inpage script runs in the page's context and is subject to these restrictions.

**Solution**: Proxy RPC calls through the background worker, with a narrow
page-local fast path for non-critical dapp reads.

The inpage bootstrap (`provider/inpage/bootstrap.ts`) installs the
`dapp/rpcForwarding.ts` `window.fetch` observer in
the page context and records HTTP(S) URLs whose request bodies look like
JSON-RPC. `dapp/rpcForwarding.ts` validates each discovered URL with
`eth_chainId` and may forward only allowlisted dapp-originated read methods to
the matching dapp RPC. Forwarded calls have a 3s timeout and fall back to the
normal background proxy on any error.

The dapp RPC fast path is intentionally not used for WalletChan-critical data:
account/chain state, signing, transaction submission, raw tx broadcast, gas
estimation, nonce reads, `eth_getCode`/delegation reads, stateful filter
lifecycle methods, `wallet_*`, and all internal confirmation/simulation/receipt
logic continue through extension-controlled RPCs.

```
Inpage                    Content Script              Background

   │                           │ {result}                 │

   │◄──────────────────────────┤                          │
```

The background worker is not subject to page CSP.
`network/safeRpcForwarding.ts`
accepts only extension-configured RPC URLs and a public read/simulation method
allowlist. It rejects URL credentials and redirects, and uses
`privateNetworkPolicy.ts` to block public sites from loopback/private IPv4,
IPv6, IPv4-mapped-IPv6, and reserved local-hostname targets. A private-origin
site may use a private configured RPC; loopback additionally requires a
loopback origin. Serialized requests are capped at 524,288 characters,
responses are streamed under 8,000,000 bytes, concurrency is capped at 16, and
each request has a 15-second timeout.

## Chain State and Switching

There is no wallet-wide selected network in the current product UI. Network
selection belongs to the relevant context: an injected dapp tab, a Send/Swap
flow, or WalletConnect. Do not describe the persisted `chainName` field as a
single global network governing all wallet activity.

### Current state ownership

- **Injected provider:** each loaded content script owns
  `bridgeState.chainName` / `bridgeState.chainId`. This is per loaded tab/document,
  not a durable per-origin chain preference. The inpage provider holds the
  corresponding public chain ID.
- **Dapp UI:** the connected-site `HomeDappDock` selects the active tab's network.
  `App.tsx` queries the tab with `getInfo` on activation and sends `setChainId`
  when its chain context changes. This renderer state is not a wallet-wide
  transaction-network authority.
- **Wallet flows:** Send and Swap have their own network selection and request
  pinning. Swap owns `sellChainId` / `buyChainId`; its `onChainChange` prop is
  currently unused. Some launch paths in `App.tsx` still update `chainName`
  while seeding a flow, so do not assume all legacy state coupling is removed.
- **WalletConnect:** `walletConnect/chainState.ts` owns the separate local
  `walletConnectChainId`, shared across WC sessions. If missing/invalid, it
  consults the shared saved `chainName`, then an eligible visible-chain fallback.
- **Shared saved context:** `chrome.storage.sync.chainName` remains a
  compatibility/initialization value. Provider switches and renderer context
  updates still write it. Already-connected pages read it to initialize their own chain; unconnected
  pages always start on Ethereum mainnet. The shared value can still carry
  context between connected pages; live tab state is not durable per-origin
  chain persistence.

### Same-origin embedded dapps

Etherscan's Write Contract panel discovers providers inside a same-origin
iframe. Inpage `sameOriginFrame.ts` reuses the top document's WalletChan provider
through EIP-6963 discovery, exposes that exact object locally, and skips the
child's independent result router. Its bound methods therefore use the top
content-script transport and existing tab chain/account state. Discovery works
whether the top provider is already ready or announces later. Other wallets'
announcements are ignored. Cross-origin/opaque frames cannot access this path,
and all direct background iframe requests remain rejected. This does not add a
cross-frame postMessage forwarding channel or weaken sender authorization.

### Pre-connection privacy and switch approval

`provider/contentBridge/initialization.ts` exposes Ethereum mainnet (`0x1`) to
unconnected sites, independently of saved `chainName`, and keeps account
addresses hidden. `eth_chainId` and `net_version` remain readable and use that
public provider state. Trusted-UI `setChainId` forwarding now checks account
permission for the target chain before publishing an update; unconnected pages
retain mainnet. Revocation resets the public chain to mainnet and invalidates
pending switch continuations. Chain revisions discard stale asynchronous UI
updates that would overwrite a newer switch.

`accountChainRoutes.ts` validates the switch target before opening approval.
Unknown/hidden chains return `4902`; malformed IDs return `-32602`. A known
switch from an unconnected site queues the existing `requestDappConnection`
flow with the requested chain ID and waits for its durable result. This works
also when the target is the public mainnet default. Rejection retains `4001`;
concurrent switch requests return `-32002`. Connection approval uses the normal
exact-origin/top-frame checks and existing request-surface opening path.

After approval the bridge reloads network metadata and account type, checks
Bankr network support, and rechecks connected-origin account visibility.
Imported Safe visibility requires an existing Safe record, not deployment or
approval capability on the requested chain. Transaction/proposal actions retain
their own exact-chain deployment and authority checks. The bridge checks revocation
again after the shared renderer-context write before publishing the switch. A request ID
correlates each switch response, so unrelated add-chain or switch responses
cannot resolve it. No signing or transaction submission is part of this flow.

`wallet_addEthereumChain` retains its existing connected-site requirement and
separate network approval; this change does not add pre-connection add-chain
support. Regression coverage lives in `tests/provider/connectionBoundary.test.ts`
and `tests/provider/inpageRouting.test.ts`.

### Connected dapp switch flow

1. `wallet_switchEthereumChain` sends `i_switchEthereumChain` to the content
   script through `provider/inpage/accountChainRequests.ts`.
2. The content script validates the configured target, connects if necessary,
   then rechecks permission and account support on that target.
3. Success updates that content script's chain and writes shared saved
   `chainName`, then posts `switchEthereumChain` back to the page.
4. The inpage provider resolves the request with `null`, updates its chain ID,
   and emits `chainChanged` only when the value changes.
5. When the chain name changes, the content script requests a background browser
   notification. The background independently checks connected-site authority.

`wallet_addEthereumChain` also requires an existing connection. Existing visible
chains can take the fast path; hidden/new networks use the approval path.
Successful additions switch only when supported for the account type. See
`accountChainRoutes.ts` and `background/chainPromptRouter.ts` for those branches.

For debugging, inspect initialization, page request handling, runtime event
forwarding, and `App.tsx` together. A shared storage key or a variable named
`globalChain` is not evidence of a current global network selector.

## Sensitive Data Encryption

Both the Bankr API key and private keys are encrypted using AES-256-GCM with PBKDF2 key derivation.

The stable `src/chrome/crypto.ts` and `cryptoUtils.ts` facades expose the
focused `src/chrome/cryptography/` implementation: bounded persisted-field
codecs, fixed PBKDF2 policy, legacy password ciphertext, 32-byte vault-key
wrapping/direct encryption, and vault-first Bankr credential lookup are
separate review boundaries. Private-key entry encryption remains behind the
stable `src/chrome/vaultCrypto.ts` facade over
`src/chrome/vault/entryCrypto.ts`, `repository.ts`, and `operations.ts`:

### Legacy System (Pre-Vault Key)

```
User Password
      │
      ▼
PBKDF2 (600,000 iterations, random salt)
      │
      ▼
AES-256-GCM Key
      │
      ▼
Encrypt Sensitive Data (random IV)
      │
      ▼
Store in chrome.storage.local:
{
  encryptedApiKey: { ... },    // API key encrypted with password
  encryptedVault: { ... },      // Private keys encrypted with password
}
```

### Vault Key System (Current)

After migration, the vault key system is used for better multi-password support:

```
Master/Agent Password
      │
      ▼
PBKDF2 (600,000 iterations)
      │
      ▼
Decrypt Vault Key from encryptedVaultKeyMaster or encryptedVaultKeyAgent
      │
      ▼
Vault Key (32-byte AES)
      │
      ▼
Decrypt Sensitive Data:
{
  encryptedVaultKeyMaster: { ... },  // Vault key encrypted with master password
  encryptedVaultKeyAgent: { ... },   // Vault key encrypted with agent password (optional)
  encryptedApiKeyVault: { ... },     // API key encrypted with vault key
  pkVault: {                         // Private keys encrypted with vault key
    entries: [
      { id: "...", keystore: { ciphertext, iv, salt: "" } }  // salt="" indicates vault-key encryption
    ]
  },
  accounts: [...]                    // Account metadata (no sensitive data)
}
```

**Migration Process**:

1. On first unlock with master password after v1.3.0+, vault key system is created
2. API key is re-encrypted with vault key → saved to `encryptedApiKeyVault`
3. All private keys are re-encrypted with vault key → `pkVault` entries updated with `salt: ""`
4. Agent password can decrypt the general vault key → that key decrypts the API key and routine-signing private keys
5. Master and agent passwords can both perform routine signing, while account/secret mutations, recovery-phrase access, factor management, and master-password rotation remain master-only

**Storage Format Detection**:

- `salt === ""` in keystore → vault-key encrypted (current format)
- `salt !== ""` in keystore → password encrypted (legacy format, backward compatible)

**IMPORTANT**: When saving credentials after vault key migration:

- API keys: Use `encryptedApiKeyVault` (encrypted with vault key), NOT `encryptedApiKey`
- Private keys: Use vault-key encryption via `encryptPrivateKeyWithVaultKey()`, NOT password encryption
- The system automatically detects which format is in use and saves to the correct location

**Security Note**: Private keys are decrypted only in the service worker for
normal signing. An explicit reveal action may return one key to the exact
trusted WalletChan UI only after fresh master-password verification; keys are
never exposed to content scripts, inpage scripts, webpages, or unrelated
extension documents. See [PK_ACCOUNTS.md](./PK_ACCOUNTS.md) for detailed
security architecture.

### Passkey/Biometric Unlock

Passkey unlock is an optional local wrapper around wallet key capabilities:

```
WebAuthn PRF output
      ├─ HKDF("vault") ─────→ unwrap general vault key
      ├─ HKDF("mnemonic") ─→ unwrap dedicated mnemonic key (V2 only)
      └─ HKDF("privacy") ──→ unwrap dedicated privacy key (when present)
                                      │
                                      ▼
                         Hydrate normal master session caches
```

- Chrome + platform authenticator + WebAuthn PRF are required. WebAuthn omits
  explicit `rp.id` / `rpId`, so Chrome uses the extension origin as the
  relying party and native prompts show `chrome-extension://...`.
- V1 records wrap only the general vault key. They existed only in
  unreleased/local development builds, not any published extension version.
  The compatibility decoder avoids stranding those local profiles and retains
  routine signing, but Add Account deliberately blocks every new local-account
  path until biometric unlock is removed and re-enabled as V2 with the master
  password.
- V2 records use purpose-separated HKDF subkeys to wrap both the general vault
  key and a dedicated mnemonic key. Setup also creates/converts the matching V2
  `mnemonicVault` in the same `chrome.storage.local.set()` call; neither half can
  commit without the other.
- Successful setup also creates or updates `privacyVault` in the same atomic
  commit. Its independent privacy key gets a master wrapper plus a
  purpose-separated passkey wrapper; the Privacy Pools phrase itself remains
  absent until first eligible Private-mode entry.
- A successful assertion from a factor that predates `privacyVault` creates an
  empty passkey-only scaffold under the wallet-secret lock. It is cached only
  in that fresh master session, so Private-mode initialization can generate the phrase
  without a main-password prompt. Agent sessions never receive this key.
- New V2 mnemonic vaults include an authenticated key check. This proves that
  the independently master-wrapped and passkey-wrapped mnemonic keys match even
  before the first phrase is stored. Populated early V2 records without the
  check remain readable by authenticating their existing entries; an empty
  early V2 passkey record requires an explicit master-password upgrade before
  biometric seed access. `getPasskeyUnlockStatus.mnemonicCapable` reports this
  stored-record distinction, while `mnemonicSessionReady` reports whether the
  current in-memory authorization generation actually holds the matching key.
  Settings offers the upgrade instead of claiming full access.
  Settings → Add Account uses the same status to hide private-key and seed
  create/import/derive controls before any secret enters renderer state; a
  signing-only legacy biometric session instead links directly to Biometric
  Unlock settings for master-password reconfiguration.
- `passkeyUnlock` lives only in `chrome.storage.local`; it is not synced.
- Passkey unlock sets `passwordType` to `"master"` but does not cache or store the master password.
- Passkey setup stores the local wrapper only after backend master-session
  validation and hydration succeed.
- Passkey creation requests the wrapping PRF output during the user-verifying
  registration ceremony and uses it directly when the authenticator returns
  it, avoiding a second biometric prompt. Authenticators that omit
  creation-time PRF results fall back to one assertion to obtain the output.
- Passkey unlock re-reads the authoritative configured `autoLockTimeout`
  before hydration and again before committing success. With native
  `storage.session`, password and passkey unlocks write the same encrypted V1
  session capability: the exact 32-byte general vault key plus, for a master
  session with Shield configured, the exact verified 32-byte privacy key.
  Agent sessions contain only the general key. A fresh AES-GCM key is split
  between the memory-backed session ciphertext and `local.sessionEncKey`; AAD
  binds the ciphertext to session/factor/password type, timeout, surface lease,
  activity/idle timing, and privacy-key identity. No password, PRF output,
  Bankr API key, private/derived key, seed phrase, mnemonic key, or privacy
  recovery phrase is persisted. Released password-Never and passkey V1/V2
  envelopes remain read-only migration inputs.
- After MV3 service-worker suspension, the restored capability rehydrates
  Bankr/private-key/already-derived seed signing and matching Shield access
  without another prompt. V2 mnemonic-decryption authority is intentionally
  not restored, so seed creation/import/derive and phrase recovery require a
  fresh V2 assertion or explicit master-password path. Browser close, manual
  lock, factor removal, password rotation, reset, malformed state, factor
  replacement, inactivity expiry, or any timeout change revokes/fails the
  capability closed. Browsers without native `storage.session` retain only
  non-secret metadata and cannot cold-restore either finite or Never sessions.
- Add Account checks `mnemonicSessionReady` before entering seed setup, before
  generating/importing, before opening an existing-group address picker, and
  again before persistence. When a cold-restored V2 session lacks the live-only
  key, the renderer runs the same WebAuthn PRF assertion and `unlockWithPasskey`
  hydration used by the unlock screen, then proceeds only after refreshed
  status proves the mnemonic key is live. Cancelling leaves all staged input in
  the current trusted renderer and performs no background mutation.
- Normal transaction/signature confirmations use the hydrated API key/private-key vault caches.
- Master-authorized vault mutations that only need the vault key work after
  biometric unlock without a cached plaintext password. This includes adding
  private-key accounts and adding/updating Bankr API credentials. UI preflights
  must check `isWalletUnlocked`, not `getCachedPassword`, for these operations.
- V2 mnemonic ciphertext is encrypted by the cached mnemonic key, so a V2
  biometric master session can create/import/preview/derive without caching the
  plaintext master password. V1 password-only vaults continue using the cached
  master password. Seed-phrase accounts sign through derived keys in `pkVault`.
- Recovery-phrase reveal always requires explicit master-password verification,
  even when a V2 mnemonic key is cached.
- Key/phrase reveal captures the auth epoch before that verification and uses
  `secretRevealHandlers.ts` to hold the wallet-secret operation lock through
  the final master-session check, decryption, and response invocation. A lock,
  password/factor mutation, or reset that linearizes first cannot receive a
  stale plaintext response afterward.
- Explicit master-password verification proves the unwrapped general key
  against every current Bankr/private/derived key and proves V2 mnemonic
  recovery. Merely decrypting a syntactically valid but unrelated replacement
  wrapper cannot authorize revealing a key already cached by biometrics.
- Secret reveal, master password changes, and passkey removal still require explicit master password verification.
- Master password change and passkey removal first prove that the general
  master wrapper recovers the Bankr credential plus every private/derived key
  with its correct account address. They also prove that the V2 mnemonic master
  wrapper decrypts every valid phrase and reproduces every seed account. A
  corrupt or mismatched-but-decryptable wrapper fails closed and preserves the
  passkey. A valid password change rewraps the dedicated mnemonic key and clears
  the passkey; reset clears all wallet material.
- Passkey and agent-factor removal revoke `local.sessionEncKey` after every
  recovery/epoch proof but before deleting the factor. A failed revocation
  leaves the factor intact. After the factor commit, in-memory authority is
  cleared synchronously; remaining native-session ciphertext is
  non-restorable residue and cleanup is best-effort. Master-password rotation
  is not vulnerable to restoration by its old envelope because its atomic
  commit replaces the master wrapper and clears the agent wrapper before
  reporting success.
- Settings → Change Password uses an explicit two-step master-password flow:
  verify the current password locally, then enter the replacement. It never
  routes a biometric session through the generic unlock screen, because a
  successful passkey assertion cannot recover the plaintext master password.
  The serialized rotation verifies the current password again before writing.
- Settings → Biometric Unlock uses the same in-Settings step-up pattern when
  enabling the factor. The shared `BiometricUnlockSetup` screen collects the
  explicit master password, calls `verifyPasskeySetupPassword`, then binds the
  WebAuthn ceremony to `setupPasskeyUnlockWithPassword`. A biometric session
  therefore stays in Settings instead of being routed through the generic
  unlock screen. Cancelling returns to the biometric status screen.
- Settings → Agent Password also collects the explicit current master password
  even when the active master session came from a passkey. The serialized
  setter unwraps and validates complete general-vault and V2 mnemonic recovery
  before writing `encryptedVaultKeyAgent`; passkey authority alone never stands
  in for plaintext master-password proof.
- `authTransition.ts` serializes session restoration plus
  lock/unlock/setup/removal/agent-factor/password/reset mutations across open
  views. Each WebAuthn ceremony carries a random
  per-service-worker epoch; any newer lock, password change, reset, factor
  removal, successful unlock, or worker restart makes the older result stale.
- Passkey payloads and stored wrappers are decoded and length-checked before
  cryptographic use (32-byte PRF input/output, 12-byte GCM IV, 48-byte wrapped
  general/mnemonic key, and WebAuthn credential IDs capped at 1023 bytes).
- Updating `lastUsedAt` is best-effort after successful hydration. Storage
  metadata failure cannot leave the UI reporting failure while caches remain
  silently unlocked, and every router branch returns a structured error.
- Explicit `lockWallet` broadcasts `suppressPasskeyAutoPrompt: true` after
  clearing auth state. Each UI surface that was already open keeps that flag
  only in renderer memory, so its unlock page skips the automatic prompt while
  retaining the manual biometric button. Closing and reopening the popup
  creates a fresh surface and auto-prompts again.
- `auth/sessionTermination.ts` acquires the wallet-secret operation lock before
  invalidating the auth epoch or clearing cached keys. This linearizes manual
  lock with account/seed mutations: a mutation that acquired the lock first
  finishes with its original key material, while a queued mutation observes a
  stale epoch and fails. Cached vault keys are never cleared halfway through a
  secret-state commit.
- `addKeyToVault` uses password encryption only for genuinely pre-migration
  wallets. If `encryptedVaultKeyMaster` exists but its cached data key has
  expired, account creation fails and asks for re-unlock; it cannot create a
  fresh mixed-format legacy entry at the auto-lock boundary.
- Automatic and manual biometric unlock share a renderer-local single-flight
  prompt gate. Starting either ceremony consumes that Unlock screen's automatic
  prompt. This prevents a successful manual unlock from scheduling a second
  WebAuthn prompt while the old Unlock screen remains mounted for its fade to
  Home; failed or cancelled ceremonies can still be retried explicitly.
- The unlock mascot is presentation-only and observes existing UI lifecycle
  state. Empty password remains sleeping even when focused; typing or an active
  password/passkey check becomes attentive; incorrect credentials become
  invalid; passkey cancellation falls back to sleeping/password mode; and a
  successful unlock commits one visual frame before the existing root fade.
  The mascot never starts, retries, cancels, or timer-gates authentication. The
  success frame is signaled at App's shared unlock-routing boundary because the
  secret-free cross-surface unlock broadcast can beat the originating callback.
  That committed success state also closes the outgoing Unlock screen's
  automatic passkey-prompt window before App clears renderer-local suppression
  for the next session, preventing a biometric prompt from appearing over Home
  after password unlock. Visible surfaces hold the completed success pose for
  500ms before the existing root fade so the sparkle reaction is legible;
  reduced-motion surfaces use a short 120ms static acknowledgment, and hidden
  sibling extension pages route immediately.

### Session Caching (Wallet Lock/Unlock)

Wallet lock flow for secure credential management:

`sessionCache.ts` remains the export-only compatibility API used by handlers.
Under `chrome/session/`, `inMemoryCache.ts` owns one decrypted capability
generation, `timeoutValues.ts` owns the pure duration allowlist,
`autoLockPolicy.ts` owns timeout normalization/storage caching,
`cacheAccess.ts` owns expiry-aware selectors, and `teardown.ts` owns complete
memory/persistence clearing. `uiSurfaceLease.ts` owns exact renderer IDs and
last-close transitions. `capabilityPersistence.ts` owns the current exact,
factor-bound general/privacy key envelope and authenticated lease metadata.
`restoration.ts` owns serialized authoritative recovery, type/factor/timeout
rechecks, legacy migration, and auth-epoch invalidation. `persistence.ts`,
`passkeyPersistence.ts`, and `passkeyCredentialRecord.ts` are retained for
released password-Never/passkey envelope migration. `storage.ts` owns the
cross-browser adapter. Lower layers never import the facade or authentication
handlers.

- Decrypted API key, **private keys vault**, and password are cached in background worker memory
- **Private keys are NEVER sent to UI** - only used internally for signing
- Cache expires after the **configurable inactivity timeout** (default: 15
  minutes) begins when the last trusted wallet surface closes
- Cache cleared on browser close or extension suspend
- When locked, user must enter password before:
  - Viewing the main wallet interface
  - Confirming any pending transactions or signature requests
- Popup, side-panel, and full-page `index.html` surfaces share one presence
  lease. While any one remains mounted (including a backgrounded full-page
  tab), finite auto-lock is paused; the last close starts a fresh timeout.
- With native `storage.session`, both password and passkey sessions survive
  service-worker suspension. Master sessions restore general + verified Shield
  capability; agent sessions restore general capability only.
- Any timeout change revokes the old persisted capability rather than
  reinterpreting it. The live worker generation remains usable under the new
  setting; the next explicit password or passkey unlock establishes a new
  restorable capability with authenticated policy metadata.

#### Agent Password (Optional Secondary Password)

Users can optionally configure an **agent password** that allows AI agents to unlock the wallet for normal operations while protecting private key reveal:

New agent passwords use the same shared 8-to-256-character and
common-password rejection policy as new master passwords.

**Storage Schema** (in `chrome.storage.local`):

| Key                       | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `encryptedVaultKeyMaster` | Vault key encrypted with master password                     |
| `encryptedVaultKeyAgent`  | Vault key encrypted with agent password (optional)           |
| `encryptedApiKeyVault`    | API key encrypted with vault key (current format)            |
| `encryptedApiKey`         | API key encrypted with password (legacy, kept for migration) |
| `agentPasswordEnabled`    | Boolean flag for UI                                          |
| `mnemonicVault`           | V1 password-encrypted phrases or V2 dedicated-key phrases + master wrapper |
| `privacyVault`            | Dedicated-key-encrypted Privacy Pools phrase + at least one master/passkey wrapper |
| `passkeyUnlock`           | V1 general-key wrapper or V2 general/mnemonic wrappers       |

**Migration**: Existing users are automatically migrated to the vault key system on first unlock with master password. The migration:

1. Generates a new 256-bit vault key
2. Encrypts vault key with master password → saved to `encryptedVaultKeyMaster`
3. Re-encrypts API key with vault key → saved to `encryptedApiKeyVault`
4. Re-encrypts all private keys with vault key → `pkVault` entries updated (v1.3.0+)
5. Keeps V1 seed phrases master-password encrypted; derived private keys in `pkVault` are migrated for routine signing. Explicit biometric setup later converts the complete V1 mnemonic vault to V2 atomically.

**Partial Migration Detection**: If the general vault-key system exists but private keys are still password-encrypted (e.g., upgraded from v1.2.0 to v1.3.0), the system automatically detects this on next master password unlock and completes the migration. Agent password unlock fails closed until migration completes. V1 mnemonics are a supported format, not a partial migration. If an interrupted older migration left only legacy `encryptedApiKey`, master-password rotation decrypts it with the old password, re-encrypts it with the unchanged general key, and clears the legacy ciphertext in the same atomic write.

**Credential Saving** (v1.3.0+): When saving/updating credentials after wallet setup:

**API Keys**:

- If `cachedVaultKey` exists → encrypt with vault key → save to `encryptedApiKeyVault`
- If no vault key and no `encryptedVaultKeyMaster` exists (pre-migration setup/legacy) → encrypt with password → save to `encryptedApiKey`
- `saveEncryptedApiKey()` refuses to write legacy `encryptedApiKey` once `encryptedVaultKeyMaster` exists, so post-migration callers must use the vault-key path
- `prepareApiKeyUpdateWithCachedPassword()` encrypts without publishing;
  account settings then commit the ciphertext and Bankr account address in one
  `chrome.storage.local.set()`, and update the in-memory API-key cache only
  after that write succeeds. A failed write therefore preserves both the old
  address and old credential. Biometric master sessions use the cached general
  vault key and refresh the API-key cache timestamp without requiring a
  plaintext password.
- Before adding or updating a Bankr account, `/wallet/sign` signs a fixed,
  harmless WalletChan challenge. WalletChan cryptographically recovers the
  signer from that signature and requires it to equal the proposed address;
  the API's self-reported `signer` field is not trusted as proof. Only one new
  Bankr account may be added because the encrypted API credential is
  wallet-wide. Existing profiles that already contain multiple Bankr rows stay
  readable, but each submission is preflight-verified against its pinned row.
- The legacy `saveApiKeyWithCachedPassword` message returns an explicit error
  and performs no mutation. Credential-only updates cannot bypass the combined
  key/address verification path.

**Private Keys**:

- If `cachedVaultKey` exists → encrypt with vault key via `encryptPrivateKeyWithVaultKey()` → save to `pkVault` with `salt: ""`
- If no vault key (legacy) → encrypt with password via `encryptPrivateKey()` → save to `pkVault` with `salt: "base64..."`
- `vault/recordCodec.ts` is the bounded released-V1 decoder. It accepts only
  version 1, at most 10,000 entries, non-empty IDs of at most 512 characters,
  12-byte IVs, bounded AES-GCM ciphertext, and either the released 16-byte
  password salt or the current empty vault-key salt. Unknown versions and
  malformed fields fail closed before decryption.
- A structurally valid V1 record with duplicate IDs remains readable so a
  profile affected by a historical read/modify/write race is not locked out.
  Add/remove/save and password/vault-key migration preparation require unique
  bounded IDs and perform zero writes for an ambiguous record. The V1 key,
  schema, ciphertext bytes, and encryption parameters are unchanged.
- Handled automatically by `addKeyToVault()` in `vault/operations.ts` and
  re-exported from `vaultCrypto.ts`; callers do
  not need a plaintext password when a biometric master session has cached the
  vault key.

**Seed Phrases**:

- V1 password-only vaults use master-password PBKDF2 + AES-256-GCM and remain readable without an eager migration.
- V2 vaults use a dedicated mnemonic key with per-group AAD. Master password and V2 passkey wrap that key independently; the agent/general vault key cannot decrypt it.
- V2 biometric master sessions may create/import/preview/derive; agent sessions remain blocked. Reveal always requires explicit master-password verification.
- `addSeedPhraseGroup` requires the trusted renderer to supply an already
  generated/entered valid phrase. Generation happens first through the
  extension-only `generateMnemonic` handler, and persistence occurs only after
  the renderer's explicit backup acknowledgement; the save handler has no
  silent-generation fallback.

**Security Invariants**:

1. Private key reveal is **always blocked** when unlocked with agent password
2. Seed phrase reveal is **always blocked** when unlocked with agent password
3. Adding seed phrases / deriving accounts is **blocked** with agent password
4. Agent password management requires the master password and proves that the
   master-wrapped general key recovers every current credential/local key before
   creating or deleting the secondary wrapper
5. Master password change requires master password (agent cannot change it)
6. Bankr API key & address change requires master password
7. Both passwords use the same auto-lock timeout
8. ERC-7715 grants and non-default/custom EIP-7702 Set operations require a
   live master session through their durable grant/raw-send boundary. Routine
   canonical-default EIP-7702 batching and all authority revocations remain
   available to agent sessions.
8. Master and agent wrapper decryption are attempted in parallel to avoid a
   password-type timing oracle
9. Changing the master password invalidates the agent and passkey wrappers; the
   user must explicitly set those secondary factors up again

#### Auto-Lock Timeout Configuration

Users can configure the auto-lock timeout via Settings → Auto-Lock:

| Option         | Value (ms) | Description                        |
| -------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 1 minute       | 60,000     | Quick lock for high security       |
| 5 minutes      | 300,000    | Short timeout                      |
| **15 minutes** | 900,000    | **Default**                        |
| 30 minutes     | 1,800,000  | Medium timeout                     |
| 1 hour         | 3,600,000  | Extended session                   |
| 4 hours        | 14,400,000 | Long session                       |
| Never          | 0          | Never auto-lock (manual lock only) |

**Implementation Details**:

- Setting stored in `chrome.storage.sync` with key `autoLockTimeout`
- Missing or invalid values resolve to and are initialized as 15 minutes on
  install/update. A stored `0` is preserved only as an explicit Never choice;
  absence never enables persisted-session restoration.
- Background worker caches the timeout value in memory for performance
- Storage change listener keeps cached value in sync across tabs
- When timeout is `0` ("Never"), inactivity validation always passes
- All credential getters enforce the same surface-aware inactivity lease,
  including vault/privacy/mnemonic keys and cached password type. An open
  trusted wallet surface pauses finite expiry; last close starts the timer.
  Expiry clears every capability together.
- `isWalletUnlocked()` accepts the legacy Bankr/private-key cache paths or one
  coherent, expiry-checked `{ general vault key, password type }` generation.
  This keeps view-only-only wallets unlocked after master, agent, biometric,
  and native-session hydration while rejecting either partial capability alone.
- Changes take effect immediately (no restart required) and revoke the old
  persisted envelope; the live worker session remains until its new policy
  applies or an explicit lock occurs
- **Validation**: `setAutoLockTimeout` validates against allowed values and returns `false` for invalid values

**Message Types**:

| Type                 | Description                                              |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `getAutoLockTimeout` | Get current timeout value                                |
| `setAutoLockTimeout` | Set new timeout value (validated against allowed values) |

#### Native Session Restoration and Wallet-Surface Lease

The extension stores one split encrypted session capability in
`chrome.storage.session` to recover from MV3 service-worker restarts without
mistaking worker lifetime for user inactivity. Password and passkey sessions
use the same record and the same surface lease. Finite auto-lock is paused while
any trusted popup, side panel, or full-page wallet surface remains mounted; the
last close starts the configured inactivity countdown. Explicit Never remains
valid until manual lock, another revoking auth transition, or browser-session
storage teardown.

This restoration is enabled only when the browser provides native,
memory-backed `chrome.storage.session`. Supported Chrome and Firefox builds do.
The local-storage compatibility fallback for browsers/forks without that API
remains available for non-secret session state, but restoration is unavailable
there: persisting both recovery halves in the profile
would expose them to an offline profile copy after the browser closes. Updated
workers proactively delete fallback password artifacts written by older builds.
That cleanup also crosses browser capability upgrades: stale `__session__*`
local ciphertext/metadata is removed after native session storage appears, and
the local key half is removed only when it is not protecting a valid current
native restorable session.

**Why This Is Needed**:

Chrome MV3 service workers are frequently suspended/restarted to save resources. When this happens:

1. All in-memory state is cleared (`cachedApiKey`, `cachedVault`, `cachedVaultKey`, etc.)
2. The `suspend` event clears cached credentials
3. Without session restoration, password/passkey sessions and Shield access
   would be shortened to worker lifetime even while the wallet remained open

```

**Security Considerations**:

- New sessions persist no password. The exact general/privacy key payload is
  encrypted with a random key that is stored as a separate recovery half.
- Session envelope parsing is exact and allocation-bounded before decoding:
  `sessionEncKey` must decode to 32 bytes, the IV to 12 bytes, and the
  authenticated ciphertext is capped at 1 MiB plus the AES-GCM tag. Malformed,
  oversized, or torn records fail closed as a locked session.
- `chrome.storage.session` is cleared when the browser closes
- Session storage is not synced across devices
- Native session storage is readable by privileged extension contexts: the
  background service worker and extension-origin pages. It is hidden from
  content scripts by default. Every privileged extension page is therefore
  inside the secret-bearing trust boundary; `TRUSTED_CONTEXTS` is the default
  access level and does not narrow storage to the worker alone.
- Browsers without native `storage.session` do not persist a restorable
  password or passkey capability; a worker restart safely returns them to the
  unlock screen.
- Restoration runs through the same serialized auth-transition queue as
  manual lock and factor/password changes. A lock that arrives during restore
  executes immediately afterward and clears the restored state; a restore
  arriving after lock sees no session to recover.
- Passkey and agent-factor removal delete the local recovery-key half before
  their factor commit. If that pre-commit removal fails, the factor is not
  changed; after commit, stale session ciphertext cannot restore a password.
- Manual lock always attempts both recovery-half deletions. Either confirmed
  deletion makes the session non-restorable. If neither succeeds, the worker
  broadcasts `walletLockFailedExternal`; every open renderer purges its auth
  state, suppresses biometric auto-prompting, and stays on a blocking retry
  surface. A worker-local barrier also rejects background restoration
  until a fresh explicit password or passkey authentication succeeds.
- Manual lock shares the wallet-secret operation serializer with account and
  recovery-material mutations. It never clears a cached data key underneath a
  mutation that already linearized first.
- A fresh passkey assertion creates a passwordless master session. A missing
  `getCachedPassword()` value is therefore not evidence that the wallet is
  locked. `tryRestoreSession()` first re-reads the authoritative timeout and
  then returns success without rehydrating when one coherent, expiry-checked
  live capability generation already exists. This preserves the current auth
  epoch, the live-only V2 mnemonic key, and the current privacy key. A fresh assertion also
  upgrades a missing pre-Shield privacy vault with a purpose-separated passkey
  wrapper before the dashboard initializes its phrase. Only genuinely cold
  state consumes the persisted envelope. Cold master restore recovers the
  verified privacy capability when present, but intentionally omits the
  mnemonic key.

**Handlers with Session Restoration**:

The following message handlers may attempt centralized, expiry-checked session
restoration when their required coherent capability is not live. Passwordless
passkey sessions must not restore merely because `getCachedPassword()` is null:

| `privacyPrepareShield`             | Revalidate and atomically persist an encrypted Shield operation, then queue only its trusted account-pinned normal confirmation |
| `privacyListShieldOperations`      | Return bounded public Shield/Unshield/recovery activity and aggregate private portfolio state; never note linkage |

The stable `delegationHandlers.ts`, `delegationStorage.ts`, and
`delegatedAuthorityPolicy.ts` files are compatibility facades over the
`delegation/` audit domain. Set intake validates a private-key/seed account,
captures master authority only for custom/non-default targets, resolves the
chain, and re-probes ERC-7821 before constructing a pinned type-4 self-call.
Queue persistence is serialized with the wallet-secret operation lock for
master-bound custom Set requests, stores the auth epoch with the pending
request, and only then notifies the UI. Revoke and canonical-default Set remain
agent-capable. `delegation/storage.ts` owns the unchanged nested
`customDelegates` record and linearizes each read-modify-write under the shared
`local:customDelegates` storage lock.

**Account pinning for prepared work**:

- Dapp-created pending txs and `wallet_sendCalls` batches are pinned at request creation with `accountId`, `accountAddress`, and `accountType`. Cross-dapp batch add/confirm handlers must resolve that pinned account directly; they must never fall back to the current active account when `params.from` is omitted or when the user switches accounts while the request is open.
- Internal swap/bridge confirmations capture `{ accountId, fromAddress }` when the quote is prepared. `executeSwapDirect`, `executeSwapBatch`, and `executeSwapAtomicPK` must resolve that locked account directly and reject if the stored account address differs from the lock, or if any prepared transaction's `tx.from` / `chainId` differs from the locked values.
- The in-wallet WCHAN staking screen uses the same pinned prepared-work
  boundary with staking-specific trusted-UI route aliases. Its
  `executeStakingDirect` route explicitly rejects impersonator accounts in the
  background, while `executeStakingBatch` is Bankr-only and
  `executeStakingAtomicPK` is private-key/seed-only. Ledger staking uses the
  ordered direct path and rechecks account address, device ID, derivation path,
  and recovered signer before each raw broadcast.

**CRITICAL: Adding New Handlers**

When adding a message handler that consumes cached authorization, distinguish a
genuinely cold worker from a live passwordless passkey session. A passkey
session intentionally has no cached plaintext password. Never use
`getCachedPassword() === null` alone as a locked-state or restoration signal.

**Required pattern:**

```typescript
// Restore only when the coherent wallet capability generation is absent.
if (!isWalletUnlocked()) {
  // The primitive owns unified lease/timeout/factor restoration policy.
  await tryRestoreSession(handleUnlockWallet);
}

const password = getCachedPassword();
const vaultKey = getCachedVaultKey();
if (!isWalletUnlocked() || (!password && !vaultKey)) {
  sendResponse({ success: false, error: "Wallet must be unlocked" });
  return;
}

// Capture an auth epoch only after any necessary cold restoration.
const operationAuthEpoch = getAuthCeremonyEpoch();
```

Then validate the operation-specific capability: Bankr work needs an API key;
general-vault writes may use either a password or vault key; V2 seed writes need
the live mnemonic key. `tryRestoreSession()` cannot synthesize an explicit
master password and cold passkey restoration deliberately cannot restore the
mnemonic key.

**Why this matters**: Chrome MV3 service workers are frequently suspended and
restarted, so a genuinely cold handler must recover an eligible session. Rehydrating
an already-live passkey session is also unsafe: it changes the authorization
generation and replaces its richer fresh-assertion capabilities with the
narrower cold-restored capability set.

**Storage Schema** (in `chrome.storage.session`):

| Key                        | Type    | Description                          |
| -------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `sessionId`                | string  | Unique session identifier            |
| `sessionStartedAt`         | number  | Timestamp when session started       |
| `autoLockNever`            | boolean | Outer Never/finite consistency marker |
| `encryptedSessionCapabilities` | object | Exact V1 AES-GCM envelope: general key plus optional master-only privacy key; AAD binds unlock method, password type, factor fingerprint, timeout, active surface IDs, lease state/activity/idle expiry, and privacy key ID. The separate 32-byte key half is `chrome.storage.local.sessionEncKey` |
| `encryptedSessionPassword` | object  | Released password-Never migration input; new unlocks never write it |
| `encryptedSessionVaultKey` | object  | Released passkey V1/V2 migration input; new unlocks never write it |

**Message Types**:

| Type                | Description                                              |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `validateSession`   | Check if session is valid (returns { valid, sessionId }) |
| `tryRestoreSession` | Attempt to restore session (returns boolean)             |

**UI Port Heartbeat and Reconnection**:

Each main wallet document (`app/hooks/useRuntimeMessaging.ts`) creates one
renderer-memory-only random `surfaceId`. Its trusted `ui-keepalive` port must
first send `{ type: "wallet-ui-register", surfaceId }`, then sends exact
secret-free `{ type: "wallet-ui-keepalive", surfaceId }` pulses every 20
seconds. Chrome 114+ no longer counts an opened-but-silent port as worker
activity. The background rejects malformed, duplicate, or changing IDs and
tracks presence by ID, not a raw connection count. Onboarding uses a separate
`onboarding-keepalive` worker-only pulse and never holds an authentication
lease.

While at least one registered wallet surface is present, finite inactivity
expiry is paused. Every heartbeat re-seals active lease metadata with a fresh
AES-GCM IV; the last disconnect seals `idleExpiresAt = now + timeout`. If a
disconnect is missed during worker suspension, the last authenticated
heartbeat is the conservative inactivity start. On restart, only the same
persisted `surfaceId` can prove continuous presence past the timeout. A new ID
must still be inside the inactivity window and cannot revive an expired
session.

When the service worker restarts unexpectedly:

1. The port disconnects
2. `onDisconnect` listener detects this
3. After 100ms delay, `establishKeepalivePort()` reconnects
4. The document re-registers its unchanged renderer-memory `surfaceId`
5. Background acknowledgement precedes lock-state restoration and heartbeat

Registration validates the previous lease before recording new presence. A
newly opened side panel after expiry routes to unlock; it cannot create a fresh
deadline. Manual lock/reset/factor changes remain immediate even with open
surfaces because they clear memory and revoke the split capability through the
serialized auth-transition queue.

**See**: `src/app/hooks/useRuntimeMessaging.ts` and
`src/app/uiKeepalive.ts` for heartbeat/reconnection behavior, and
`src/chrome/background/lifecycle/trustedUiPorts.ts` for exact trusted-sender and
pulse-shape enforcement.

#### Password Caching for API Key Changes

When changing the API key while the wallet is unlocked:

- Uses the **cached password** to encrypt the new API key
- No need to re-enter password if session is active
- If cache expires, prompts for "Current Password" with message "Session expired"
- Existing API key is **pre-filled** in the form (decrypted from cache)

#### Password Change Flow

When changing the wallet password (Settings → Change Password):

- **Explicit current password required**: A biometric session proves possession of
  the vault key but does not contain the plaintext master password. The user must
  enter the current master password before rotation.
- **Two-step verification**: `verifyMasterPassword` advances the Settings UI,
  while `changePassword` independently re-verifies the same password inside the
  serialized mutation. The first check is never treated as authorization for the
  second step.
- **Agent sessions are blocked in the background**: The guard restores a persisted
  "Never" session first, so a service-worker restart cannot turn an agent session
  into an untyped session that bypasses the restriction.
- **Shared new-password policy**: The replacement must be 8 to 256 characters
  and must not match the common-password denylist. Existing shorter passwords
  remain valid only as the current-password proof so legacy wallets stay accessible.
- **Cache cleared**: After password change, user must unlock with new password
- Password handling stays entirely in background worker (never exposed to UI)

**With Vault Key System** (current) — atomic write pattern:

1. Decrypt the master vault-key wrapper with the explicitly entered current password.
   Require the result to be a 32-byte key that recovers the current non-empty
   Bankr credential and every `pkVault` entry, with every local key reproducing
   its account address. Abort without writes on malformed/missing/mismatched data.
2. If a V2 mnemonic vault exists, unwrap its mnemonic key through the current
   master wrapper, validate every BIP39 phrase and seed-group record, and
   re-derive every seed-account address. Abort without writes on any mismatch.
3. Compute the new general vault-key wrapper and either a new V2 mnemonic-key
   master wrapper (ciphertext entries unchanged) or replacement V1 phrase
   ciphertext (all in memory)
4. If a partial migration left `encryptedApiKey` without
   `encryptedApiKeyVault`, migrate the credential to the unchanged general key
   and clear the legacy ciphertext in the final atomic write. If `pkVault`
   contains legacy password-encrypted entries from a partial migration, migrate
   only those entries to the vault key in memory; existing vault-key entries
   are preserved byte-for-byte
5. Decrypt and byte-compare the prepared master wrapper before any storage
   write, so a verification failure cannot be reported after rotation commits
6. **Single atomic `chrome.storage.local.set()`** writes all changed encrypted data
   and clears the agent/passkey wrappers together
7. **Capability-encrypted data stays unchanged**:
   - API key (in `encryptedApiKeyVault`) unchanged
   - Private keys (in `pkVault` with `salt: ""`) unchanged
   - V2 seed-phrase ciphertext unchanged; only `masterWrappedKey` changes
8. **Secondary factors are cleared** - `encryptedVaultKeyAgent` and
   `passkeyUnlock` must be set up again after the master password changes
9. In-memory credentials and the restorable session record are cleared, and all
   open extension surfaces are told to route to unlock

**Why atomic**: If any re-encryption step fails (OOM, crypto error), no storage writes happen. Without atomicity, the vault key could be updated to the new password while legacy entries remain encrypted with the old password, making data inaccessible.

**Note (v1.3.0+)**: After migration, `pkVault` entries are encrypted with the
general vault key (`salt: ""`). V1 `mnemonicVault` phrases are re-encrypted on
password changes; V2 phrase ciphertext stays under its dedicated mnemonic key
and only the master wrapper is rotated.

**Legacy System** (pre-vault key migration):

1. Decrypt API key, private-key vault, and mnemonic vault with old password
2. Re-encrypt all present legacy secrets with new password in memory
3. Persist `encryptedApiKey`, `pkVault`, and `mnemonicVault` together in one `chrome.storage.local.set()` call

### Pending User-Review Request Storage

Transactions, signatures, ERC-5792 batches, cross-dapp batches, dapp
connections, add-chain prompts, watch-asset prompts, and ERC-7715 permission
requests are stored persistently in `chrome.storage.local`:

- Closing popup does NOT reject/cancel pending transactions
- Pending requests survive popup close, browser restart
- Extension badge shows count of pending requests
- User-review prompts do not auto-expire. Injected dapps wait without a local
  timer, persisted rows survive browser/service-worker restarts, and every
  Bankr/private-key/seed confirmation path ignores request age.
- WalletConnect transaction/signature/permission routing records also remain
  until the prompt resolves. Only short-lived pre-prompt intake claims and
  already-terminal relay response records retain bounded cleanup.
- A prompt remains pending until the user confirms/rejects it or an
  explicit authorization, WalletConnect-session, account, reset, or
  cancellation lifecycle terminalizes it.
- Save/remove writes are serialized with `storageLock.ts`.
- ERC-5792 batch intake may briefly persist a non-actionable
  `intakeStatus: "validating"` row after account/origin pinning. This lets a
  cold sidepanel render the real request before an atomic EIP-7702 RPC probe
  returns. The marker is removed only after the second pending authorization
  check, bundle-status write, durable reread, and final authorization check;
  every Bankr/private-key/seed confirmation path fails closed while it exists.
- `requests/pendingRequestResolution.ts` installs a synchronous, first-action-wins
  claim before any confirmation/rejection work starts. Popup, side panel, and
  full-page surfaces therefore cannot concurrently confirm/reject the same
  transaction, signature, `wallet_sendCalls` bundle, dapp connection, or
  cross-dapp batch. The Bankr, private-key, seed-phrase, and legacy transaction
  routes share the same per-request claim namespace.
- Request editing/splitting uses the same claim. Moving a transaction or
  `wallet_sendCalls` bundle into the cross-dapp batch atomically claims both the
  source request and destination batch, preventing a direct confirmation from
  racing the move and submitting the call twice.
- Terminal handlers remove durable pending state before the claim is released;
  late actions treat a missing request as a tombstone and never overwrite its
  result. Fulfilled pre-effect failures (for example an invalid password) leave
  the request pending and release the claim for retry. Unexpected exceptions
  retain the claim fail-closed for the service-worker lifetime because a remote
  signer or RPC broadcast may already have accepted the operation.
- The older `processingTxIds` / `processingBundleIds` guards remain as
  defense-in-depth for background processing, but they are not the atomic
  resolution boundary.
- Async transaction and batch handlers install a short-lived effect lease
  before returning to the router. The lease keeps rejection and wallet
  reset excluded after durable pending state is consumed and until the
  background signer/submission path reaches its final authorization check.
  Signature handlers remain awaited by the router and also hold an explicit
  lease across local or Bankr signing. Local transaction preparation invokes
  its final account + transport authorization from an after-sign,
  before-broadcast hook. Effect guards release for failures proven to occur
  before publication. Once raw bytes cross the RPC boundary, a lost response
  is committed as a durable pending `broadcastUncertain` hash rather than a
  retryable failure.
- `resetExtension` owns a global resolution barrier before its first password
  or storage await. Reset fails visibly while any confirm/reject/expiry/grant or
  background effect lease is active; a resolving request likewise cannot start
  while reset owns the barrier. Extension-internal direct swap/bridge,
  sponsored-transfer, and atomic swap paths enter the same barrier even though
  they do not originate from a persisted dapp prompt. Fire-and-forget Bankr and
  EIP-7702 swap processors transfer the router claim to an effect lease before
  returning.
- Every externally sourced pending record carries either exact injected
  `{tabId, frameId, senderOrigin}` provenance, exact WalletConnect
  `{topic, requestId, method}` provenance, or an explicit `trustedInternal`
  marker written by the service worker. Legacy/partial external records fail
  closed at confirmation. Cross-dapp entries preserve this provenance when
  moved out of their original queue.
- Bankr transaction, signature, and ERC-5792 pending rows also carry a
  non-secret SHA-256 tag of the authenticated API-key ciphertext generation.
  ERC-5792 intake attaches this tag before its first authorization check and
  persists that same generation; the storage boundary rejects a pre-bound row
  if credential rotation made its tag stale instead of silently retargeting
  the reviewed request.
  Confirmation recomputes that tag at the last safe point; changing the global
  Bankr credential invalidates every older prompt instead of silently signing
  it through a different remote wallet. Pre-upgrade Bankr prompts without a
  tag fail closed. Cross-dapp entries copy the tag before their source row is
  removed. Bankr submit performs its harmless signature challenge first, then
  acquires the wallet-secret operation lock, revalidates pinned account plus
  transport/tag authority, and starts `/wallet/submit` synchronously before
  releasing that lock. A credential rotation during the challenge therefore
  cannot cross the irreversible boundary. Local and Bankr signature handlers
  likewise revalidate after signing and discard the capability if account,
  dapp/WalletConnect authority, or credential generation changed meanwhile.
- Cross-dapp confirmation revalidates each distinct source. It captures all
  injected revocation and WalletConnect termination epochs before async reads,
  then performs one synchronous collective commit immediately before submit.
  A source revoked while another source is still awaiting is removed and
  terminalized without broadcasting; unrelated source groups remain queued.
- User can review and confirm/reject at any time

#### Pending Requests List

When multiple transactions are pending:

- Shows all pending requests with **request numbers** (#1, #2, etc.)
- Displays: origin favicon, hostname, chain badge, timestamp, target address
- Click any request to view full details
- **Reject All** button at the bottom to reject all pending transactions

## Request Surface Positioning

When a dapp connection, transaction, batch, signature, or ERC-7715 permission request is
received, the background worker opens the configured surface. Sidepanel mode
uses the early user-activated route described above at every browser window
size. Popup mode uses a detached window positioned at the top-right of the
dapp's window, including when the user explicitly selected popup mode while
fullscreen.

**See**: `src/chrome/windowing/requestSurface.ts` for surface selection and
`windowing/popupGeometry.ts` / `popupWindow.ts` for placement, reuse, and
creation. `provider/contentBridge/requestSurface.ts` caches the non-secret
sidepanel preference and recognizes the five approval families;
`windowing/providerRequestSurface.ts` consumes the original request gesture,
owns the short-lived cold-renderer hint, and owns the fullscreen notification
fallback. `app/initialApprovalRequests.ts` gates initial routing on the hinted
queue without moving request payloads into the renderer. `extensionPopup.ts`
is an export-only compatibility facade.

**Multi-Monitor Support**:

- Uses `senderWindowId` from the message sender's tab to identify the correct window
- Falls back to `chrome.windows.getLastFocused()` if sender window not available
- Allows negative `left` coordinates for monitors positioned left of primary
- Clamps the fixed-size popup to the sender window's work area when that window
  is narrower or shorter than the preferred placement
- Popup appears on the same monitor as the dapp requesting the transaction

## Cancellation

Users can cancel in-progress transactions (PK/Seed Phrase accounts only):

1. **Local Abort**: `AbortController` aborts the in-flight RPC broadcast

**Bankr API accounts** cannot be cancelled — `/wallet/submit` is synchronous (tx is already broadcast onchain by the time the response returns). The cancel button is hidden in the UI for Bankr account transactions.

## Response Handling

The `/wallet/submit` API returns a structured response:

- `status: "success"` — transaction confirmed onchain, `transactionHash` contains the hash
- `status: "reverted"` — transaction confirmed but reverted, treated as failure
- `status: "pending"` — transaction submitted but not yet confirmed, treated as success
- `submitTransactionDirect()` normalizes `txHash` to `transactionHash`, requires a valid EVM transaction hash for every accepted status, and throws `BankrApiError` for missing/invalid `status`, `success !== true` on non-reverted responses, invalid JSON, or ambiguous pending bodies. This prevents Activity rows from being left pending without a pollable transaction hash.
- Bankr `/wallet/sign`, `/wallet/submit`, and job bodies are streamed under
  fixed byte ceilings and conservative deadlines. Signatures must be 65-byte
  EVM signatures, self-reported signer/type fields must match the request, and
  WalletChan recovers personal-sign/EIP-712 signatures locally before use.
  Submit responses must include the exact reviewed signer, chain ID, and valid
  transaction hash. A harmless signer challenge runs before the irreversible
  submit request; only the submit request flips the effect lease to ambiguous.
  Abort, timeout, oversized, or malformed post-submit responses retain the
  lease and tell the user the outcome is unknown and to check Activity before
  retrying. HTTP 408/409/425/429 and 5xx are also ambiguous; bounded,
  non-retryable 4xx validation/auth failures remain
  definite. Bankr requests reject redirects so the API key cannot follow a
  backend redirect to another origin. Chat prompt submission uses the same
  deadline/byte/error-text bounds and validates the returned job ID before
  polling.

### Popup → Background (chrome.runtime)

`background/messageAccessPolicy.ts` is the exhaustive audience declaration for
the main service-worker router: every route in `background/messagePipeline.ts` and every
declared delegated-router route is classified exactly once as `wallet-ui` or
`provider`. Popup/sidepanel/onboarding routes are accepted
only from the exact top-level extension documents recognized by
`trustedWalletUiSender.ts`; an unknown or wallet-UI route from a content script
fails closed. Provider-classified routes still pass through the effect-free
`provider/messageValidation.ts` dispatcher before dispatch. Its focused
transaction, signature, batch, metadata, identifier/URL, resource-limit, and
chain-boundary modules are shared directly with injected-provider and
WalletConnect callers; there are no root compatibility shims. ENS browsing and
the embedded explorer decoder's two public-metadata messages remain deliberate
pre-router exceptions with their own exact sender/page policies.

Provider rejection delivery is described by the pure mapping in
`background/providerRequestRejection.ts`, which fixes each provider method to its existing
storage result key/payload, direct response, or intentional no-write behavior.
This keeps the injected-provider transport auditable without loading the full
service worker. `getActiveAccount` remains provider-reachable only for provider
initialization address correction.

After the ENS, audience, provider-validation, and ERC-7715 gates, the main
listener delegates unlock, lock, passkey, password, agent-password,
session-status, and auto-lock messages to `background/authRouter.ts`.
That router returns an explicit `handled/keepChannelOpen` result, preserving
Chrome's synchronous versus asynchronous `sendResponse` contract while all
authentication, storage, and locking behavior stays in the existing services.

Wallet-wide Bankr credential reads and replacement are isolated in
`background/bankrCredentialRouter.ts`. Replacement still validates the account
row and proves the remote signer before entering the wallet-secret lock; inside
that lock it rechecks the prepared master-auth epoch, atomically commits the
account address plus encrypted credential, and only then publishes the prepared
credential to memory. Sync mirrors, mapped-tab updates, and the UI broadcast
remain best effort after that commit. Cached-key reads retain exact Wallet UI
sender checks, Never-session restoration, and the agent-session plaintext
block. The retired credential-only mutation remains an explicit no-op error for
stale popup builds.

The same post-validation boundary delegates fresh-wallet marker inspection,
credential initialization, completion, rollback, and the completion broadcast
to `background/onboardingRouter.ts`. WalletConnect identity retirement and
ephemeral avatar-cache invalidation are injected by
`background/composition/identityRoutes.ts`, keeping
build-environment and SDK state out of the testable transport module. The
non-secret account read/order/name/global-selection/tab-selection routes are
delegated separately to `background/accountStateRouter.ts`.
`background/accountManagementRouter.ts` owns the trusted-UI transport and
orchestration for the serialized legacy migration, master-gated Bankr,
view-only, private-key, and seed account/group mutations, centralized
private-key import recovery, and disconnect-before-delete removal. Storage locks,
credential preparation, auth epochs, sponsored-intent exclusion, dapp
revocation, and mutation handlers remain injected boundaries.
`background/secretManagementRouter.ts` separately owns direct trusted-sender
checks for mnemonic generation and secret reveal, pinned-account signature
confirmation with terminal-only result publication, and ERC-7715 confirm/reject
transport. Plaintext, signing, and delegated-authority policy remain in their
domain handlers.

ERC-5792 provider capability/send/status/show routes and trusted-UI batch
confirmation, rejection, edit, and split decisions are delegated to
`background/batchRequestRouter.ts`. Injected calls preserve the exact authorized
origin, tab/frame/window, favicon, and sender-tab account; provider responses
stay on their existing durable result keys. Every decision retains its
`batchTransaction` or `transaction` first-action claim before invoking Bankr,
local signer, edit, or split handlers. WalletConnect adapters continue to enter
the same batch domain with their session metadata rather than this injected
sender transport.

`background/delegationRouter.ts` forwards the trusted-UI EIP-7702
status/probe/set/revoke calls without moving authorization or transaction
preparation out of the delegation domain. `background/crossDappBatchRouter.ts`
retains the two-claim source-plus-active-batch lease for moving a transaction
or ERC-5792 bundle, and the single active-batch claim for edit/reject/confirm.
Password, gas-estimate, source fan-out, and conflict semantics are passed
unchanged to the injected handlers.

`background/settingsRouter.ts` handles only trusted Wallet UI network
registry mutations and popup/sidepanel display-mode messages. Network
normalization, RPC URL policy, and the `networksInfo` storage lock stay in the
`network/` validation/repository/mutation modules. Browser capability, display
mode, panel verification, and popup placement stay in `windowing/` behind the
export-only `sidepanelManager.ts` / `extensionPopup.ts` facades. Chrome
storage/action/window calls are isolated in `windowing/chromeAdapter.ts` and
injected into focused policies; `background/composition/identityRoutes.ts`
consumes only the stable public functions.
Provider-originated add-chain intake,
confirmation, rejection, and per-tab chain notifications remain in the main
provider-aware flow.

Dapp account exposure, durable connection intake, permission reads, connection
confirmation/rejection, and revocation are
delegated to `background/dappPermissionRouter.ts` only after the existing
audience and external-provider validation gates. The router passes the exact
Chrome sender into origin/tab-bound domain handlers; result persistence,
pending-request claims, popup/badge effects, and permission broadcasts remain
in those handlers. `background/walletConnectSessionRouter.ts` separately
forwards the four trusted-UI WalletConnect list/pair/disconnect/chain-selection
routes to injected SDK handlers, avoiding relay SDK initialization when the
router is imported in isolation.

Injected read-only RPC transport is delegated separately to
`background/providerRpcRouter.ts`. It forwards the exact Chrome sender into the
connected-dapp authorization boundary, uses only the returned canonical origin
for bounded safe-RPC forwarding, and publishes success or rejection on the
existing `rpcResult:{id}` durable channel. It intentionally does not hold a
Chrome response channel open.

Shared provider-ingress policy is split into audit-sized helpers without
changing the ordered `background/messagePipeline.ts`. `background/providerIngress.ts` owns
connected-origin resolution, durable provider rejection, and the ERC-7715
in-progress block. `background/signatureValidation.ts` owns method rejection,
bounded EIP-712 validation/sanitization, and exact sender-scope forwarding.
`background/chainSwitchNotification.ts` owns chain validation, the
portfolio-refresh signal that precedes notification cooldown, safe extension
icon resolution, and the existing per-tab/origin/chain cooldown.

Metadata prompts are split because the combined transport exceeds the 400-line
audit budget. `background/watchAssetRouter.ts` owns EIP-747 intake,
pending reads, and first-action-wins confirmation/rejection, including durable
provider results and custom-token/unhide commits. `background/chainPromptRouter.ts`
owns EIP-3085 intake and decisions plus connected-site chain-switch notices,
including origin-bound RPC validation and network registry commits. Both run
after provider validation and pass the exact sender/authorization metadata
into existing policy boundaries. Their persisted prompts have no age-based
expiry; the shared metadata lifecycle service only handles explicit origin
invalidation.

Single transaction and signature transport is delegated to
`background/signingRequestRouter.ts`. Provider intake keeps the exact sender,
tab, frame, window, and authorized origin supplied by the composition root;
trusted-UI reads, rejection, and cancellation preserve the synchronous
first-action claim and durable-result ordering of the underlying domain
services. A read-only `getTransactionNonce` route resolves only the account
pinned to a PK/seed/Ledger request and does not claim or advance it. The four
single-transaction confirmation paths move together through
`background/transactionExecutionRouter.ts`: immediate Bankr submission,
background Bankr submission, local private-key/seed-phrase execution, and
Ledger execution all claim `transaction:<id>` with action `confirm` before
invoking their injected domain handler. Immediate confirmation retains the
existing terminal-result non-overwrite check, and local/Ledger confirmation
retains explicit-tab then sender-tab resolution plus the applicable function,
gas, force-inclusion, fee-token, and nonce arguments. Internal transfer intake
forwards the complete message without creating a false signing claim.

`background/swapExecutionRouter.ts` forwards exact account/address locks to the
direct Bankr/local, Bankr batch, and local atomic paths. Every path first enters
the injected `internalOperation` reset barrier; signer-specific effect leases
remain below it in `transactions/swaps/`. `background/sponsoredTransferRouter.ts`
uses the same barrier only for relayer submission, while status reconciliation
stays fail-closed with `hasUnresolved: true` and acknowledgement remains
retryable. `background/transactionStatusRouter.ts` separately handles only
trusted-UI history, processing, failed-notification, nonce-cache, enrichment,
and receipt-status messages. These transport routers do not resolve credentials
or perform signing, submission, receipt polling, or request authorization
themselves.

`background/resetRouter.ts` owns the trusted-UI `privacyGetResetRisk` and
`resetExtension` routes; `background/reset/execution.ts` contains the injected,
audit-sized destructive sequence. Reset requires an explicit boolean Shield-loss
acknowledgement whenever the public preflight detects Shield data. It installs
the global pending-resolution barrier synchronously only after that gate, then
performs the serialized restored-master proof, unresolved sponsored-intent
guard, auth and WalletConnect invalidation, secret-locked security reset, exact
local/sync manifest deletion, badge cleanup, and notification cleanup in
released order. Its response channel remains open for the complete asynchronous
sequence.

Read-only quote and token helper transport is also separated from effectful
execution. `background/swapBridgeDataRouter.ts` owns exact swap/bridge request
shapes, source/destination chain discovery, cached bridge tokens/chains, and
swap token-list reads. `background/tokenDataRouter.ts` owns token metadata and
custom-token CRUD, price/image/CoinGecko/logo helpers, and allowance/balance
reads. Both run only after the exhaustive audience gate; avatar proxying keeps
its defense-in-depth exact Wallet UI check, while all asynchronous response
shapes and Chrome channel lifetimes remain unchanged.

`background.ts` is now a five-line MV3 entrypoint that only invokes
`background/bootstrap.ts`. Bootstrap constructs the audit-sized route families
under `background/composition/`, creates the ENS-first/audience/provider-gated
`background/messagePipeline.ts`, and hands it to
`background/composition/lifecycle.ts`. That lifecycle composition registers
storage/auth-lock, tab-account, maintenance, install/update, startup recovery,
action fallback, trusted-UI ports, the single ordered `onMessage` listener, then
notification clicks. The focused callback implementations remain under
`background/lifecycle/`, whose README records service-worker execution order.

### Background → Views (chrome.runtime broadcast)

| Type                         | Description                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `txHistoryUpdated`           | Notifies views with compact `txId`, `ownerAddress`, `chainId`, and optional `changedKeys`; no transaction or transfer payload is broadcast. |
| `newPendingTxRequest`        | Notifies views of new pending transaction       |
| `newPendingSignatureRequest` | Notifies views of new pending signature request |
| `accountsUpdated`            | Notifies views that accounts list changed       |
| `addressContactsUpdated`     | Notifies views that the ordered contact list changed |
| `walletLockedExternal`       | Force-lock signal (password rotation, agent removal, manual lock) — all surfaces route to unlock screen. Manual lock adds `suppressPasskeyAutoPrompt: true` so only already-open surfaces skip their automatic biometric prompt. |
| `walletLockFailedExternal`   | Fail-closed manual-lock signal — every open wallet surface purges renderer auth state, suppresses automatic biometric prompting, and shows the blocking retry screen. |
| `walletUnlockedExternal`     | Unlock-sync signal — sibling surfaces (sidepanel + full-screen tab) auto-unlock by re-running their post-unlock flow against the SW credential cache |
| `ping`                       | Check if any extension view is open             |

### Views → Background (response)

| Type   | Description                      |
| ------ | -------------------------------- |
| `pong` | Response indicating view is open |

## Sidepanel Support

The extension supports the Chromium Side Panel API when the runtime exposes
both `chrome.sidePanel.setPanelBehavior()` and `chrome.sidePanel.open()`.
Capability detection is deliberately vendor-neutral: Chrome and Brave use the
same sidepanel path. Arc remains an explicit popup-only exception through the
renderer-detected `isArcBrowser` policy. Multiple verified fallback layers keep
the popup available when an advertised sidepanel fails to open.

### Browser Compatibility

| Browser       | Sidepanel Support                    | Default Mode |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| Google Chrome | ✅ Complete API                      | Sidepanel    |
| Brave         | ✅ Complete API                      | Sidepanel    |
| Arc           | ❌ Explicitly suppressed             | Popup        |
| Other Chromium forks | Capability-driven             | Sidepanel when the complete API exists |
| Firefox       | ❌ No `chrome.sidePanel` API         | Popup        |

### Capability and Arc Detection

Arc's sidePanel API is a "perfect phantom" — `sidePanel.open()` can resolve and
`getContexts()` can report a `SIDE_PANEL` context even though no usable panel is
rendered. Arc therefore needs its own explicit browser policy instead of being
grouped with every non-Google Chromium browser.

The service worker therefore treats the actual extension API as the general
capability boundary instead of requiring a `Google Chrome` UA brand:

```typescript
function detectSidePanelSupport(chromeApi): boolean {
  return Boolean(
    chromeApi?.sidePanel &&
      typeof chromeApi.sidePanel.setPanelBehavior === "function" &&
      typeof chromeApi.sidePanel.open === "function",
  );
}
```

The renderer separately detects Arc through `--arc-palette-title` in `App.tsx`
and onboarding, then persists `isArcBrowser`. Every async capability query,
mode transition, and service-worker initialization applies that Arc override
after the vendor-neutral API check. Runtime windowing does not inspect UA brand
strings.

### How It Works — Never Use `openPanelOnActionClick`

**Key design rule**: Never set `openPanelOnActionClick: true`. It's an all-or-nothing setting — when true, Chrome suppresses the popup completely. If the sidepanel doesn't work (Arc), there's no fallback and nothing happens on icon click.

Instead, the extension controls popup vs sidepanel via `chrome.action.setPopup()`:

- **Popup mode**: `setPopup({ popup: 'popup-init.html' })` → native popup opens on icon click
- **Sidepanel mode**: `setPopup({ popup: '' })` → `chrome.action.onClicked` fires → calls `sidePanel.open()` with try/catch fallback

### Configuration

| Setting     | Storage Key         | Default                                 | Description                                       |
| ----------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Mode        | `sidePanelMode`     | `true` (after onboarding, if supported) | Whether to use sidepanel or popup                 |
| Legacy      | `sidePanelVerified` | Unused; released key remains resettable | Preserved only for storage compatibility          |
| Arc Browser | `isArcBrowser`      | Detected via CSS variable (legacy)      | Whether running in Arc browser (legacy detection) |

### UI Toggle

A sidepanel toggle button is available on both the **unlock screen**
(top-right corner) and **main view header** when the complete sidepanel API is
available and the browser is not Arc.

When toggling from popup to sidepanel mode:

- The setting is persisted in `chrome.storage.sync`
- `chrome.action.setPopup({ popup: '' })` is called so `action.onClicked` fires on icon click
- A toast notification instructs user to close popup and click extension icon

When toggling from sidepanel to popup mode:

- `chrome.action.setPopup({ popup: 'popup-init.html' })` restores the native popup
- The service worker opens WalletChan's detached popup window before closing the sidepanel; native action popups cannot be used here because Chrome dismisses them during the sidepanel focus change
- The sidepanel uses `sidePanel.close()` on Chrome 141+, with `window.close()` as the compatibility fallback after the detached popup is confirmed open

### Transaction Requests

When a dapp requests a transaction, the extension opens the appropriate UI:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     Transaction Request Flow                                │

│  1. Background receives eth_sendTransaction from dapp                       │
│  2. Stores pending tx in chrome.storage.local                               │
│  3. Broadcasts "newPendingTxRequest" message to all extension views         │
│  4. If sidepanel mode:                                                      │
│     a. Ping existing views — if "pong" response, view is open, done        │
│     b. Try sidePanel.open() + verify via getContexts                       │
│     c. If verification fails → fall through without rewriting preference   │
│  5. If popup mode (or fallback):                                            │
│     - Check for existing popup window → focus it                            │
│     - Otherwise create new popup window positioned at dapp window           │

### Message Types for Sidepanel

| Type                   | Direction          | Description                                     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `ping`                 | Background → Views | Check if any extension view is open             |
| `pong`                 | Views → Background | Response indicating view is open                |
| `newPendingTxRequest`  | Background → Views | Notify views of new pending transaction         |
| `openPopupWindow`      | Views → Background | Request to open a popup window                  |
| `setArcBrowser`        | Views → Background | Notify background that Arc browser was detected |
| `isSidePanelSupported` | Views → Background | Check complete API support and stored Arc override |
| `setSidePanelMode`     | Views → Background | Enable/disable sidepanel mode                   |
| `switchSidePanelToPopup` | Views → Background | Close sidepanel, then open the replacement popup |

### Key Design Decisions

**Capability-driven sidepanel**: Sidepanel is enabled on Chrome, Brave, and
other Chromium browsers that expose the complete API WalletChan needs. Browser
vendor names are not used as a proxy for support.

**Verified fallback**: The `action.onClicked` listener and `openExtensionPopup()` both verify the panel after `sidePanel.open()`. If verification fails, they open a detached popup for the current request without mutating the user's stored preference.

**Never `openPanelOnActionClick`**: This setting is always `false`. Using `chrome.action.setPopup()` to control behavior provides a fallback path — `action.onClicked` fires when popup is empty, allowing try/catch around `sidePanel.open()`.

**Arc-specific exclusion**: Arc's renderer signal and stored `isArcBrowser`
flag remain a separate popup-only policy. This keeps Arc suppressed without
blocking capable Chromium forks such as Brave.

### CSS Handling

The extension detects if it's running in a sidepanel context by checking window dimensions:

- Sidepanel: height > 620px (browser provides more vertical space)
- Popup: height ≤ 600px (fixed popup dimensions)

When in sidepanel:

- `body.sidepanel-mode` class is added
- CSS adjusts to use full viewport height (100vh)

## UI Layout

### Popup Dimensions

- Detached window: 360px width, 680px height (created by `windowing/popupWindow.ts`)
- HTML: 360px width, 600px height (fixed for popup)
- Sidepanel: 100vh height (no max-height restriction)
- Font: Inter (UI), JetBrains Mono (code/addresses)

### Transaction/Signature Confirmation Layout

The confirmation views share the mobile confirmation shell:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ←  │               Request title              │  Copy    │  ← Header
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                 < 1/2 >          Reject all                │  ← Queue
│                    Requesting app                           │
│                Human-readable meaning                       │
│               Review details / Advanced                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Signing with …                                             │
│  Reject                                  Confirm / Sign      │  ← Sticky
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Back arrow**: Returns to the pending list or main view
- **Navigation**: Shared queue row before request identity; only shown when
  multiple combined requests exist
- **Reject all**: Uses the global combined-queue action
- **Title**: "Transaction request", "Batch request", or "Signature request"
- **Footer**: Shared sticky action layout keeps the pinned signer and decisions
  visible

### Pending Requests List

The list shows both transaction and signature requests. Each request shows:

- Request number badge (#1, #2, etc.)
- Origin favicon with white background (handles transparent icons)
- Origin hostname
- Type badge: **TX** (blue) or **SIG** (orange/warning)
- Chain badge with icon
- Relative timestamp ("2 mins ago")
- For transactions: Target address (truncated)
- For signatures: Method name (e.g., "Personal Sign", "Typed Data")

### Origin Favicon Styling

Origin favicons are displayed with a white background container to handle transparent icons. Falls back to Google's favicon service if no favicon is available.

### Homepage Layout

The main view (after unlock) shows:

1. **Header**: Chat History button (Bankr accounts only), Lock button, Sidepanel toggle (if supported), Settings icon
2. **Account Switcher**: Account avatar/name and a compact address utility row:
   - Truncated active-account address
   - QR button (opens the existing Receive modal)
   - Copy button with inline icon feedback
   - Explorer link icon
3. **Primary Actions**: Send, Swap, Shield, and More. Shield currently opens a placeholder screen with the standard back-navigation header.
4. **Chain Selector**: Dropdown to select network where the current surface exposes it
5. **Pending Transaction Banner** (if any pending)
6. **Recent Transactions** (TxStatusList):
   - Shows last 5 transactions by default (filtered by current account)
   - Expandable to show all
   - Empty state: "No recent transactions"
7. **Footer**: "Chat with Bankr" button (Bankr accounts only)

**Note**: The Chat History button in the header and "Chat with Bankr" button in the footer are only visible when the currently selected account is a Bankr API account. Private Key accounts do not have access to the Bankr chat feature.

### Lock Wallet Button

The header includes a lock icon button that allows users to manually lock the wallet:

- Clears the cached API key and password from memory
- Redirects to the unlock screen
- Useful for security when stepping away from the computer

Sends `lockWallet` message to background and redirects to the unlock screen.

### Reset Extension

The unlock screen first sends `privacyGetResetRisk`. When Shield data exists it
requires the user to acknowledge that the Shield phrase is saved or that the
fund-loss risk is accepted, then sends `resetExtension` with that exact boolean.
The handler is agent-password blocked, calls `clearAllAuthState()` before storage
mutation, aborts in-flight tx work through `performSecurityReset()`, then removes
wallet-owned storage through `chrome/walletResetStorage.ts`.

Before cache deletion, reset and fresh onboarding call
`invalidateAvatarImageCacheForWalletReset()` through the stable root facade.
`avatar/scheduler.ts` increments a wallet epoch, aborts active remote image
controllers, clears request deduplication state, and requires every
queued/decode/write stage to match the current epoch. Repository commits are
serialized; if an asynchronous storage write crosses reset,
`avatar/repository.ts` removes that stale entry before returning. A late
old-wallet response therefore cannot repopulate `ensAvatarImageCache` after a
replacement wallet starts.

`walletResetStorage.ts` is the stable facade over
`storage/resetManifest.ts`, the pure source of truth for reset-owned keys and
prefixes. It clears secrets/accounts (`encrypted*`, `pkVault`, `mnemonicVault`,
`privacyVault`,
`accounts`, `seedGroups`), pending request queues (`pendingTxRequests`,
`pendingSignatureRequests`, `pendingBatchTxRequests`,
`pendingWatchAssetRequests`, `pendingAddChainRequests`), WalletConnect routing
state (`walletConnectPendingRequests`, `walletConnectChainId`), cross-dapp batch
state (`crossDappBatch`, `bundleStatuses`), bridge state (`pendingBridges`),
short-lived sponsored-transfer recovery state (`sponsoredTransferIntents`),
wallet portfolio state (`portfolioSnapshots`, `portfolioSnapshotsV2`, `portfolioHoldingsCache`,
`hiddenPortfolioTokens`, `customTokens`, `customDelegates`,
`recentlyReceivedTokens`), and transient
result/artifact prefixes (`txResult:`, `sigResult:`, `rpcResult:`,
`addChainResult:`, `watchAssetResult:`, `batchTxResult:`, `batchTxAck:`,
`capabilitiesResult:`, `callsStatusResult:`, `notification-`, `fiProgress:`).
Keep that module in sync with `_docs/STORAGE.md` when adding new wallet-scoped
storage.

The reset handler separately closes and deletes IndexedDB
`walletchan-privacy-v1` while still holding the wallet-secret/reset barriers.
That database cannot be expressed in the `chrome.storage` reset manifest and
must remain explicitly wired through `background/composition/dataRoutes.ts`.

WalletConnect SDK identity is handled separately: reset first tears down the
current SDK and writes a replacement `walletConnectStorageNamespace`, then
clears the reset-owned keys above. The namespace is intentionally retained so
the replacement wallet cannot reopen the old SDK store.

### Footer Attribution

All main screens display a centered footer with attribution:

- **Text**: "Built by @apoorveth"
- **X Logo**: SVG icon linking to https://x.com/apoorveth
- **Pages with footer**:
  - Homepage (main view)
  - Unlock/Password screen
  - Onboarding (welcome, form steps, success)
  - Settings page

## Security Considerations

1. **API Key Protection**: Encrypted with AES-256-GCM; passwords are never
   stored in plaintext. Native "Never" sessions may store only an encrypted
   password or encrypted passkey-unwrapped general capability with its random
   key split across memory-backed session storage and local storage; fallback
   browsers do not persist either recovery half. Passkey session state never
   stores the PRF output, API key, private keys, seed phrases, or mnemonic key.
2. **Chain Restriction**: Only 4 supported chains, validated at multiple layers
3. **User Confirmation**: Every transaction requires explicit user approval
4. **Origin Display**: Shows requesting dapp's origin in confirmation popup
5. **Cancellation**: Users can cancel long-running transactions

## Error Handling

| Error                       | Handling                         |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Unsupported chain           | Immediate rejection with message |
| API key not configured      | Redirect to settings             |
| Wrong password              | Retry prompt in popup            |
| API error                   | Display error message; chat prompt errors surface the Bankr API `message` field in the assistant error bubble |
| RPC/preparation error before signed bytes are sent | Definite failure; keep/reopen the request and allow retry |
| Local raw-send response lost | Persist the deterministic hash as pending/`broadcastUncertain`, poll it, and do not create a new transaction or higher-nonce tail |
| Bankr submit abort/timeout/408/409/425/429/5xx or unprovable response | Outcome unknown; retain the effect lease and direct the user to check Activity before retrying |

## React State Management

### Transaction Component Keys

The `TransactionConfirmation` component uses `key={selectedTxRequest.id}` to force React to remount when switching between transactions. This ensures:

- All closures capture fresh values
- No stale state when confirming/rejecting
- Correct transaction ID sent to background

### Avoiding Stale State

When handling transaction completion, always capture the current transaction ID before async operations and reload pending requests fresh from storage rather than using React state. This prevents the common bug where async operations use stale closure values.

## In-wallet WCHAN staking

The More → Stake row opens `components/Staking/StakingScreen.tsx` inside the
extension instead of navigating to the website. The screen is Base-pinned and
loads WCHAN balance, sWCHAN balance, allowance, current penalty, weighted last
deposit timestamp, earned WETH, and deposit/redeem previews through the
trusted-wallet-UI-only `getWchanStakingState` route. The sibling
`getWchanVaultApy` route returns the website's canonical bounded 7-day WCHAN,
WETH, and total APY projection. `chrome/staking/` owns the
bounded configured-RPC reads and shares the generated contract-address package
with the website.

The renderer creates the same vault calls used by the website:

- stake: optional exact-amount WCHAN `approve(amount)`, then
  `WCHANVault.deposit(amount, account)`;
- unstake: `WCHANVault.redeem(shares, account, account)`;
- rewards: `WCHANVault.claimRewards()`.

Approval plus deposit is encoded as one ERC-7821 batch for Bankr accounts and
as an EIP-7702 atomic batch for private-key/seed accounts with a resolved
delegate. Otherwise calls are broadcast in reviewed order. Ledger never uses
the atomic path and prompts on-device once per sequential leg. View-only
accounts may read the screen but the renderer and background staking route both
reject submission. All execution aliases enter the internal reset barrier and
retain `{ accountId, fromAddress, chainId }` pinning.
Single-call private-key/seed reviews publish their resolved gas parameters to
the same confirmation-validity gate as wrapped and sequential batches; a
successful estimate therefore enables confirmation and is reused at broadcast.
Approval-first batches use the final reviewed action as their Activity title,
so staking records remain “Stake WCHAN” while the approval/deposit breakdown
stays available in the batch detail.

## Cross-Chain Bridging

The Swap surface doubles as a Bridge surface when `sellChainId !== buyChainId`. There is no separate Bridge entry point — Bankr/private-key/seed accounts use the same UI, confirmation screen, and wallet-type routing. Safe accounts use this surface only for same-chain proposals until destination Safe deployment verification is available. See `_docs/BRIDGE.md` → "Extension support" for the full breakdown.

### Architecture

```
SwapView (flow-owned sellChainId and buyChainId; selector does not update dapp chain)
  │
  ├─ same chain → existing 0x swap (fetchSwapPrice / Quote)
  │
  └─ different chain → bridge mode
       1. fetchBridgeQuote → walletchan.eth.sh/api/bridge/quote
          (server applies sWCHAN-tiered fee; same isPremiumFee surfaced)
       2. route selection → use manualRoutes[0]; the server adapts Socket V3
          result.routes[] into this legacy field.
       3. handlePrepareBridge → re-quote and use approvalData + txData from
          manualRoutes[0] directly. Socket V3 has no build-tx or submit step.
       4. SwapTxEntry[]: [approve?, bridge] with bridge meta on the last entry
          (requestHash stores Socket's quoteId for status polling)
       5. SwapConfirmation (same screen) renders with bridgeMeta prop —
          title flips, dest chain badge appears, gas plumbing unchanged.
       6. Bankr path: encodeBatchCalls → ERC-7821 atomic via executeSwapBatch.
          PK / Seed path: EIP-7702 atomic via executeSwapAtomicPK when a delegate
          is available; otherwise sequential via executeSwapDirect.
```

### Persisting & polling destination status

| Concern | File |
|---|---|
| Bridge metadata on `CompletedTransaction` | `apps/extension/src/chrome/txHistoryStorage.ts` (optional `bridge?` field) |
| In-flight bridges across SW restarts | `apps/extension/src/chrome/requests/pendingBridgeStorage.ts` (`pendingBridges` chrome.storage.local key) |
| Status polling | Stable `apps/extension/src/chrome/bridgeStatusPoller.ts` facade over `bridge/statusPolling.ts` and `bridge/statusApplication.ts` (5s → 30s exp. backoff, 15-min cap, stored quoteId/requestHash, terminal `BungeeStatusCode` values) |
| Post-source-tx hook | `txReceiptPoller.applyReceiptToHistory` calls `maybeStartBridgePolling(txId)` on success; the Bankr direct-success path in `transactions/swaps/bankrLeg.ts` does the same |
| Service-worker restart resilience | `background/composition/lifecycle.ts` injects `resumePendingBridgePollers()` into `background/lifecycle/startupRecovery.ts` |
| Browser notification | `bridge/statusNotification.ts` maps terminal copy and stores the **destination** explorer URL under `notification-<id>` before using the shared Chrome notification effect |

The bridge poller uses the same in-memory model as `txReceiptPoller` (no `chrome.alarms`). Tradeoff: destination updates only progress while the SW is alive. The resume hook covers SW death — the next popup-open eventually catches the terminal state and fires the notification.

## Safe multisig accounts

Safe support is a separate authority and transaction domain under
`apps/extension/src/chrome/safe/`; a `type: "safe"` account is never passed to
Bankr, private-key, seed, impersonator, message-signing, swap-execution,
bridge, delegation, sponsored-transfer, or force-inclusion fallbacks. The staged
`VITE_SAFE_ROLLOUT_PHASE` policy can stop at `disabled`, `readOnly`,
`approvals`, `execution`, or `provider`; features absent from the central map
remain denied.

Import resolves every EVM network in Safe's live Config Service, validates
proxy runtime and singleton lineage against exact released Safe artifacts, and
reads owners, contract-owner code, threshold, nonce, modules, guard, and
fallback at one exact block. Each chain has its own configuration epoch and
capability. Contract/nested owners and unknown authority extensions remain
visible but block signing; EIP-7702 delegated EOAs remain EOA owners.
The service worker uses a generated compact projection of the pinned Safe
Deployments artifacts containing every network alias, released address, and
code hash but no unused ABI or bytecode. Deterministic tests compare that
projection with the installed official package. Safe transaction hashing uses
the exact chain-bound SafeTx EIP-712 schema for supported versions 1.3.0–1.5.0.

There is no WalletChan Safe-chain allowlist. Discovery intersects Safe's live
registry with WalletChan's shared visible-network policy: visible built-ins and
visible user-added custom networks participate by exact chain ID, while hidden
networks are skipped until the user shows them in Settings. The user's
configured RPC takes precedence; a public no-auth RPC from Safe Config is a
validated fallback. An unprefixed address scans that visible intersection, and
a numeric `<chainId>:<address>` prefix targets one visible network. Safe
documents zkSync Era as non-EVM compatible, so the EVM integration excludes
chain 324. Transaction Service paths always use EIP-55 checksum addresses
because the upstream rejects lowercase address path parameters.

The durable repositories are `safeAccounts`, `safeProposals`, and
`safeSyncState`. Proposal IDs bind chain, Safe address, and `safeTxHash`, and
records contain immutable calls/transaction fields, reviewed configuration,
validated confirmations, optional provider/WC/ERC-5792 route, and first-action
effect claims. Proposal and outer execution hashes are always distinct. Safe
Transaction Service state is coordination data: sync merges validated remote
confirmations but cannot downgrade a locally claimed, prepared, or broadcast
effect or erase its deterministic hash/signed bytes. Direct proposal
reconciliation uses the same claim-preserving merge. A worker-local active-claim
registry prevents periodic stale recovery from cancelling a live Bankr, local,
or Ledger operation; startup recovery explicitly ignores that
empty-after-restart registry so durable claims from a dead worker are still
repaired immediately. Owner approval completion merges its recovered signature
into the latest stored confirmation set under the proposal lock, preserving
approvals received during a Ledger hardware wait. Publication completion
likewise merges published markers into the current confirmation set instead of
overwriting approvals received during its network request. An opportunistic
in-memory receipt poller starts immediately after outer execution, while a dedicated
30-second Chrome alarm and every service-worker startup reconcile unresolved
executions independently of the slower Transaction Service sync. Receipt reads
try the selected RPC first and then WalletChan's pinned built-in/canonical
endpoints. A provider exception is never collapsed into “receipt not found”:
if every trusted endpoint fails, the durable request carries an explicit
retrying RPC warning until any endpoint responds. Safe sync also recovers stale
claims and deduplicates privacy-safe notifications. On service-worker startup,
approval claims return to a retryable local state, publication claims become
ambiguous until reconciled with the Transaction Service, and execution claims
retain any deterministic hash/signed bytes for exact-envelope reconciliation.
Idempotent local-cancellation route results are replayed so a worker shutdown
between terminal storage and provider delivery cannot strand the caller.
New wallet, injected, WalletConnect, ERC-5792, and Safe-swap proposals first
refresh the Safe directly onchain, then reserve the lowest unused nonce at or
above that value while holding the `safeProposals` storage lock. Pending local
and service-verified records reserve their nonce; confirmed executed/replaced
evidence advances a stale local floor without reserving the old nonce. This makes concurrent
dapp intake deterministic and prevents an ordinary request from silently
becoming a same-nonce replacement. A future-nonce request enters the ordinary
draft/approval lifecycle immediately: every linked Bankr, private-key,
seed-phrase, or Ledger owner may sign and publish its confirmation before the
preceding nonce executes. Nonce ordering gates only final estimation/execution,
which still requires the proposal nonce to equal the freshly verified onchain
nonce. Released records that stored future requests as `blocked` remain
approvable and migrate into the ordinary lifecycle after their next signature.
If a competitor consumed a queued request's nonce, the proposal and its
provider/ERC-5792 route are terminalized.
An unsigned local cancellation does not consume its Safe nonce. If the same
reviewed calls are requested again at that nonce, the allocator atomically
reactivates the one cancelled `safeTxHash` identity with the new provider route
instead of rejecting its durable terminal record as a duplicate. Signed,
published, rejected-onchain, prepared, and broadcast records are never reset.
Concurrent retries remain serialized: one may reactivate the free nonce while
the next reserves the following nonce.
Selecting a Safe or opening the popup/sidepanel while one is active also sends
the trusted-UI-only `syncSafeRequests` message. It runs the same validated sync
for that exact Safe immediately; the Safe Requests header exposes the same
targeted path as a manual reload. Full and per-Safe work is serialized and
deduplicated so alarm, open, account-switch, and manual triggers cannot race.
Request review uses the trusted-UI `refreshSafeAccount` route to re-verify the
stored Safe directly through the configured RPC on the proposal's exact chain.
It does not repeat Safe discovery or require a Transaction Service info lookup,
so a transient service miss cannot misreport a deployed Safe as unavailable;
RPC or authority-verification failure still blocks signing until a fresh review
succeeds. The Safe security screen may omit the chain ID to refresh every
previously imported chain.

Owner authorization selects one concrete WalletChan record. Bankr signs via
the pinned credential/session-restoring typed-data path; private-key and seed
owners use requested-account-only local key resolution; Ledger owners reuse the
central device-bound EIP-712 signer. Every signature is recovered against
locally rebuilt Safe EIP-712 data and the current owner set before
persistence/publication. Impersonators, Safe accounts, contract owners,
duplicate/removed owners, and unknown Safe signature types never count toward
quorum. Agent passwords may approve or execute ordinary Safe transactions but
cannot reveal secrets or authorize future configuration changes.

`safe/accountTypePolicy.ts` is the single account-type extension point for this
flow. Its exhaustive matrix covers every `AccountType` and independently
declares owner signing, outer execution, the central signing path, and
fee-token execution. Safe discovery, capability derivation, durable proposal
decoding, owner authorization, execution, and renderer account filtering use
its guards and derived types. Adding a wallet type therefore fails compilation
until its Safe capabilities are chosen, without duplicating eligibility lists
throughout the feature.

Safe Transaction Service traffic goes directly from the extension to Safe's
official gateway. There is no WalletChan Safe API route, server credential, or
telemetry hop. `safe/serviceRegistry.ts` fetches and memory-caches the official
Config Service, rejects duplicate/malformed chain IDs, excludes non-EVM
networks, and accepts Transaction Service URLs only under the exact
`https://api.safe.global/tx-service/*` boundary. `safe/serviceClient.ts`
restricts operation paths and methods, checksums address parameters, rejects
redirects and ambient credentials, and bounds response size/time. Proposal and
confirmation writes use the same direct boundary.

Broad owner/address discovery is start-rate-limited below Safe gateway's
per-second quota and retries one explicit `429` with bounded backoff. This
prevents a broad visible-network scan from silently dropping later chains.
Owner discovery paginates the visible Safe intersection in four-chain batches and the
renderer appends each verified batch immediately rather than waiting for the
complete scan. When visible, Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, and OP Mainnet lead;
the remaining mainnets follow a checked-in DefiLlama activity snapshot (24-hour
fees with TVL fallback), followed by the other visible networks and testnets.
The activity snapshot affects latency only, not eligibility. The UI progress
total therefore matches the user's visible Safe-supported chain count. It
renders each verified chain as its resolved network logo with the chain name in
a hover tooltip. The trusted handler bounds batch offsets/limits and resolves
the same selected account ID afresh on every page. Before the first batch, a
zero-chain count-only page resolves that total without making a Safe owner
query. The centered loading state appears synchronously as `Finding Safes…`
while that local count preflight resolves, then becomes
`Checked 0 of N networks` rather than displaying
an unknown/zero total.

Owner discovery is scoped to one exact account ID selected in the Add Safe UI.
Selecting that owner starts the progressive lookup immediately; there is no
second submit action. Selecting a discovered Safe reuses its already verified
snapshots and suppresses the manual-address auto-probe, avoiding duplicate Safe
service and RPC traffic.
Both owner discovery and manual address probing register their exact verified
snapshots in a bounded, 30-minute, service-worker-memory receipt cache. The
renderer receives only opaque receipt IDs. `importSafeAccount` requires those
IDs to match the requested Safe address and every selected chain, recomputes
local-owner capability against current accounts, and persists the cached
snapshots without repeating Safe-service or RPC verification. Receipts are
discarded after a successful import; worker restart, expiry, address mismatch,
or chain mismatch fails closed and requires a fresh check. No verification
receipt is written to Chrome storage.
The background resolves that ID against current
Bankr/private-key/seed/Ledger records
and passes only that one address to `findSafesOwnedByAccount`; view-only, Safe,
missing, or stale IDs fail before network access. Direct Safe-address import is
a separate Safe-service preflight followed by exact onchain verification and
discloses no local owner address.

Safe account settings exposes **Refresh Safe details**. With no exact chain
requested, the background starts two independent paths concurrently: configured
RPC verification for every already imported snapshot, and Safe Transaction
Service discovery across only the remaining visible Safe-supported networks.
A Transaction Service hit is never persisted by itself; the candidate must pass
the same exact onchain proxy, singleton, version, owner, threshold, module,
guard, and fallback verification before its chain-keyed snapshot is merged into
the existing address account. Service discovery errors are returned as bounded
partial-status metadata and do not fail or downgrade a successful known-chain
RPC refresh. Exact-chain proposal review retains its narrower direct-RPC-only
behavior and never broadens into discovery.
Account settings keeps the complete authority card visible when the Safe has one
verified deployment. With multiple deployments it instead shows one compact,
collapsed network row per chain; the accessible one-at-a-time accordion reveals
nonce, Safe Wallet link, owners, singleton, threshold, service status, and
security-extension details only for the selected chain.

On the homepage, Safe accounts reuse the same `HomeQuickActions` component as
Bankr, private-key, and seed-phrase accounts so Send, Swap, Shield, and More
retain identical order, icon geometry, sound, focus, and hover behavior. Safe
Send and Swap always remain enterable because wallet-initiated actions do not
inherit a global/dapp chain. Their shared network browsers keep every visible
network searchable, rank verified Safe deployments first, and disable
undeployed rows with a **Safe not deployed** label; final review also rejects a
stale unsupported selection. Shield stays visible but disabled. No
Safe-only action row is added. Pending proposals surface through one compact approval banner whose
View action opens the approvals inbox; Safe security remains in account
settings. The banner and Chrome action badge share `safe/proposalStatus.ts`:
all unresolved records, including blocked/stale requests, count as pending;
executed, cancelled, replaced, failed, and hidden records do not. Activity
normalizes Safe service JSON origin metadata before display,
bounds each proposal row, and hides the transaction empty state whenever Safe
proposal activity is present.
When a Safe is connected to the active dapp, the bottom dock's network drawer
continues to show every visible network but enables selection only for chain IDs
present in that Safe's verified snapshot map. Other rows remain searchable and
are labeled **Safe not deployed**. The renderer reloads this public chain set
after a Safe network refresh; ordinary account types retain the unrestricted
drawer. Selectable Safe deployments are ranked above unsupported rows before
the existing funded-value and Ethereum ordering is applied. The WalletConnect
screen's network chooser uses the same verified chain set and ordering: every
visible network remains listed, undeployed rows are disabled and labeled, and
only verified Safe deployments can change WalletConnect's active chain.

The approval inbox is presented as **Safe Requests**. Its header uses the
official Safe mark, and its account block directly reuses
`AccountSettingsIdentity` so name/type/address/copy/explorer behavior stays
identical to account settings. `SafeProposalRow.tsx` composes the shared
separator-list primitives and `safeProposalPresentation.ts` projects validated
records into human action, a wallet/contact-resolved counterparty, and lifecycle
status. The leading chain logo owns network context; rows do not repeat the
chain name or Safe-service origin in text. Each visible row shows its actual
Safe nonce as **Nonce #N**; same-nonce alternatives deliberately repeat it. For
verified future-nonce records, `safeProposalSequence.ts` resolves the freshly
verified live nonce or earliest pending lower nonce for the same Safe and chain.
Before quorum the row says **Needs approval · Queued**; at quorum it says
**Queued · Execute nonce #N first**. Configuration-blocked rows remain simply
**Blocked**, so the UI never invents a nonce dependency.
There is no raw proposal-creation form in this inbox; reviewed wallet, provider,
WalletConnect, and batch intake remain the proposal creation boundaries.

The wallet Swap surface is also a reviewed Safe proposal boundary for
same-chain swaps. It obtains the same firm quote and ordered approval/Permit2/
swap calls as the legacy wallet paths, but `swapSubmissionModel.ts` routes a
Safe to `safeSwapProposal.ts` before any Bankr or local EOA execution handler.
That adapter normalizes call values and creates a wallet-origin draft through
`createSafeProposal`; the Safe transaction builder performs canonical
MultiSend wrapping when multiple calls must be atomic. The renderer opens that
proposal in the shared Safe request screen, where
Bankr/private-key/seed/Ledger owners approve and a selected EOA later pays
execution gas. Impersonators remain
blocked. Cross-chain Safe bridge selection remains disabled because reusing a
Safe address on another network is unsafe until WalletChan verifies that the
destination Safe deployment exists there.

Opening a Safe row now uses the same `ConfirmationScreen` information order as
single and batch transaction requests: requesting-app identity, chain-qualified
estimated changes, read-only reviewed call cards, progressive advanced details,
and one sticky decision bar. Safe lifecycle state and validated owner progress
stay inside Request details instead of creating a separate Safe-shaped approval
form. Advanced details permits changing the nonce only while a request is
unsigned. The trusted-UI `changeSafeProposalNonce` route re-verifies live Safe
configuration and the minimum onchain nonce, then atomically replaces the
proposal identity without changing its calls or dapp route. Advanced details
keeps this exceptional action behind a pencil beside the nonce; its inline
editor accepts an already reserved nonce as a deliberate competing replacement,
while automatic intake never does so. Before quorum the footer says
**Signing with** and defaults to the first available linked owner, including
while a later Safe nonce is queued behind an earlier request. At
`readyToExecute` it changes to **Execute with**,
defaults to a locally controlled Safe owner, and exposes the other supported
private-key/seed/Ledger accounts through the identity dropdown. The exact outer
`execTransaction` request is passed through the normal local-account gas tier
and custom-fee component plus the shared fee-token selector. Fee-token
availability and quotes are recomputed for the selected executor and proposal
chain; a quote for one executor cannot authorize another. Ledger executors see
native gas only and reuse the normal device-wait status while approving the
outer transaction. When quorum is reached on a future nonce, the executor
identity remains visible but fee estimation and Execute stay disabled with the
earlier nonce named; refreshing the Safe enables them once that nonce becomes
current. That nonce reconciliation derives draft/awaiting/ready state again
from the validated stored confirmations and live threshold, repairing a
service-merge lag where the confirmation count already reached quorum while
the durable state still said `awaitingApprovals`. Safe approval and
execution never render an inline
password field: like ordinary transaction/signature confirmation, they consume
the current expiry-checked master/agent/passkey session and fail closed with an
unlock instruction if no coherent signing capability can be restored. The
renderer also pins the action the user pressed for the lifetime of that UI
operation. Intermediate `authorizing`, `publishing`, and execution-claim
storage writes therefore retain the Approve/Execute loader instead of briefly
falling through to a Back action.

Safe request asset simulation is selected explicitly for every proposal; it
does not infer Safe identity from whether quorum has already made an outer
execution request available. Candidate discovery traces each reviewed
underlying call directly from the Safe and supplements the access lists with
bounded calldata-derived token addresses. It never treats a Safe proxy's
non-empty response to an unsupported ERC-7821 `execute` selector as proof that
the underlying assets were visited. Before quorum, this Safe-address pass owns
the estimated deltas. Once quorum exists, the same deltas are merged with an
exact signed `execTransaction` simulation, whose outer-envelope result remains
the authoritative revert verdict. Underlying Safe calls also receive the
shared persistent ERC-20/Permit2 approval projection. An exact outer revert
clears those permission rows; if the exact envelope cannot be simulated, rows
are retained only as unverified so the underlying-call approximation is never
presented as final Safe state.

Reject remains available beside the primary action through quorum. With no
collected signature it terminalizes the unsigned request locally. Once any EOA
or visible unsupported confirmation exists, `startSafeProposalRejection`
creates or reuses Safe Protocol Kit's canonical rejection envelope: an empty,
zero-value call from the Safe to itself at the original nonce. The replacement
is a distinct durable proposal, collects a fresh threshold through the normal
Bankr/private-key/seed approval path, and uses the normal local executor and
exact-envelope gas flow. Back is navigation only; pending signed proposals
cannot be hidden. The original record and its injected/WalletConnect/ERC-5792
result route become cancelled/failed only after the rejection transaction has
a successful onchain receipt. If the original wins the nonce race, the
rejection proposal is instead marked replaced.

Execution refreshes authority, packs sorted confirmations, and estimates and
simulates the exact `execTransaction` envelope for the selected local executor.
Once an executor is selected, the estimated-change preview runs two read-only
simulations in parallel. The underlying-call pass executes the reviewed calls
directly from the Safe address and owns Safe token/native deltas. Its isolated
TxSimulator override fully replaces the Safe proxy code and storage, preventing
proxy slot 0 from colliding with the simulator's slot-zero NFT receipt array.
Because that replacement cannot faithfully execute a Safe self-call such as
`addOwnerWithThreshold`, a second pass invokes the exact signed
`execTransaction` envelope from the selected executor without replacing the
Safe. That exact outer pass owns the success/revert verdict; an unavailable
outer pass is reported as unavailable rather than inheriting a false revert
from the underlying pass. The same isolated override remains used by single,
batch, and injected batch-gas simulation paths for every account type.
The shared transaction fee control supplies bounded gas-limit and EIP-1559
overrides; the background validates them and repeats the exact envelope
simulation immediately before RPC submission. A revert keeps execution blocked
by default, but the shared likely-to-fail confirmation lets the user explicitly
proceed; that literal boolean acknowledgement is forwarded to the background,
which may tolerate only the simulation error while retaining every live Safe,
executor, auth-epoch, gas, serialization, and duplicate-submit gate. The
broadcaster persists the
exact serialized outer transaction and its deterministic hash before crossing
the RPC boundary. Any durable execution claim, hash, or signed-byte record
blocks both renderer and background from preparing another outer transaction,
even if a stale service response says the proposal is ready. Lost responses
become `ambiguous`; reconciliation starts automatically, checks receipt and
Safe nonce, and may resend only those identical signed bytes with bounded
backoff. At that same irreversible boundary, WalletChan adds one deterministic
normal transaction-history record for the private-key, seed-phrase, or Ledger executor
that pays gas. Its `from` is the executor, its `to` is the Safe, and its data is
the exact outer `execTransaction` envelope, so only the executor account's
Activity list receives the normal history row. That row also stores the Safe
address and nonce in additive `safeExecutionMeta`; Activity uses the marker to
show the Safe logo and `Execute Safe Tx #n` instead of the originating dapp's
generic contract-interaction identity. The ordinary
receipt poller owns pending, confirmed, reverted, gas, asset-change, and details
behavior. Transaction details retain that semantic Safe execution label when
the asynchronous calldata decoder later resolves the technical outer function
as `execTransaction`; the lower-level decode remains available in Advanced
details. Safe reconciliation only repairs and resumes that same row after an
MV3 restart. A visible review wakes this same background route every ten seconds;
it does not own or infer terminal state. The confirmation footer becomes a
passive **Confirming onchain…** state rather than offering another Execute or
routine manual reconcile action. If every receipt RPC is unavailable, a yellow
**RPC unavailable. WalletChan will keep checking automatically.** notice makes
the delay explicit without treating it as execution failure. Reset and account
removal are blocked while a Safe effect is unresolved. When the selected record
transitions to `executed`, the request surface closes automatically and Home
opens the Safe account's Activity tab; loading an already-terminal Activity
record does not retrigger that navigation. Safe Activity retains all visible
proposal records, sorts them by descending Safe nonce, and projects them through
the same date-grouped ledger, origin identity, chain badge, and inline status
grammar as ordinary transaction Activity. Visible Safe rows resolve the same
local calldata function names as transaction details and reuse the batch action
summary, so single and multi-call labels do not fall back to generic request
copy when the reviewed calldata is decodable. The resolver keys its retained
result by proposal ID and calldata rather than refreshed proposal-array identity,
so routine Safe synchronization cannot flash the generic fallback between
equivalent records. The app records whether a proposal
detail was opened from Activity; its Back action then returns directly to the
Activity tab through the same tab-precedence action used by ordinary transaction
details, while the screen stack restores the saved Activity scroll position.

Injected dapp connection and account reads expose the selected imported Safe
after the ordinary origin permission grant, independently of cached signing
capability or the connection request's network. The connection picker therefore
allows Safe selection just like the ordinary account switcher; it does not label
a missing chain snapshot as observe-only or block address sharing. The background
still requires the imported Safe record and enabled injected-dapp feature.
WalletConnect session negotiation retains its exact verified, actionable-chain
requirements. Safe message signing/EIP-1271 remains disabled. Transaction
requests reuse the durable proposal state, and `eth_sendTransaction` receives
only the real outer transaction hash after execution; `safeTxHash` is never an
Ethereum transaction result. ERC-5792 tracks the proposal under a WalletChan
bundle ID, releases that ID to injected/WalletConnect callers only after the
first explicit owner authorization, and attaches the execution receipt after
success. WalletConnect retains the pre-authorization request in its durable
terminal outbox, so a worker restart cannot turn the draft into an early ACK.


### ENS L2 reverse lookup resilience

Individual and batched identity lookups fall back to the official L2 reverse
registrar when the mainnet Universal Resolver returns no name or its gateway
fails. This is restricted to the documented Base, Optimism, Arbitrum, Linea,
and Scroll mainnet deployments, uses configured RPCs with bounded transport,
checks the registrar coin type, sanitizes the name, and requires same-chain
forward verification. Saved account/contact mainnet profile selection is unchanged.
Old negative cache entries on these chains expire on read; new results carry
reverseVersion 2. Registrar deployments are pinned from the ENS reverse registrar
documentation and must be reviewed if ENS changes them.

### Safe transaction review warnings

`chrome/safe/transactionRisk.ts` provides bounded, presentation-only analysis for
exact-schema external SafeTx V3/V4 requests and imported Safe proposals.
`components/SafeReview/SafeTransactionWarnings.tsx` renders warnings outside the
clear-signing/simulation branches, shared across every owner signer type. A known
MultiSend address only suppresses the delegatecall warning when the signed domain
matches the request chain, the pinned deployment metadata explicitly maps that chain,
and complete canonical ABI decoding yields exclusively CALL entries. Inner/nested
delegatecalls, unknown chains, malformed or oversized batches retain the warning.
This does not classify underlying calls as harmless. Zero-length batch call data
is decoded as 0x without attempting an out-of-range viem slice at the buffer end.

Every nonzero signed gasPrice produces a compact gas-reimbursement warning with
payment asset and recipient details; zero refundReceiver is Transaction submitter.
Imported proposals retain their original signed fields/hash. Refund-bearing rejection
proposals no longer imply that the whole Safe execution has no asset changes.
Warnings do not alter confirmation permissions, signatures, or existing simulations,
and do not add amount estimates. `SafeRiskDecision` uses the shared SIWE
`WarningAcknowledgementPopover` in the sticky decision area, with critical red
styling and a full-trigger-width disclosure. Both the primary button and its UI
handler require acknowledgement. `useSafeRiskDecision` synchronously resets it
for exact payload, chain, request and actor/action changes, including A → B → A.
The confirmation button shows a warning triangle while acknowledgement is missing.
The `/test#safe-signatures` playground has V3/V4 controls for both warnings, nested batches and negative controls.
