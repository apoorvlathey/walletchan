# Storage Key Reference

Complete reference of every `chrome.storage` key used by BankrWallet. Consult this before any release that touches storage — see [PUBLISHING.md](./PUBLISHING.md) for the migration rules and pre-release checklist.

## chrome.storage.local

Persists across extension restarts. Cleared only on manual reset or uninstall.

### Encryption & Vault Keys

| Key | Shape | Description | Introduced |
|-----|-------|-------------|------------|
| `encryptedApiKey` | `{ ciphertext, iv, salt }` (base64) | API key encrypted directly with password via PBKDF2 + AES-256-GCM. **Legacy format** — kept after vault key migration for fallback. | v0.1.0 |
| `encryptedApiKeyVault` | `{ ciphertext, iv }` (base64) | API key encrypted with the vault key (no salt — key is raw). **Current format.** | v1.0.0 |
| `encryptedVaultKeyMaster` | `{ ciphertext, iv, salt }` (base64) | Vault key encrypted with the master password. Presence of this key means vault key system is active. | v1.0.0 |
| `encryptedVaultKeyAgent` | `{ ciphertext, iv, salt }` (base64) | Vault key encrypted with the agent password. Only exists when agent password is enabled. | v1.0.0 |
| `agentPasswordEnabled` | `boolean` | Whether agent password is set up. | v1.0.0 |

**Encryption chain (current):** password → PBKDF2 → decrypts `encryptedVaultKeyMaster` → vault key → decrypts `encryptedApiKeyVault`, `pkVault`, `mnemonicVault`

### Accounts

| Key | Shape | Description | Introduced |
|-----|-------|-------------|------------|
| `accounts` | `Account[]` — `{ id, type, address, displayName?, createdAt }` | All account metadata. Types: `bankr`, `privateKey`, `seedPhrase`, `impersonator`. | v1.0.0 |
| `seedGroups` | `SeedGroup[]` — `{ id, name, createdAt, accountCount }` | Metadata for imported BIP39 seed phrase groups. | v1.0.0 |
| `pkVault` | `{ version: 1, entries: [{ id, keystore }] }` | Encrypted private keys. `id` matches account ID. Keystore is AES-256-GCM encrypted with vault key (`salt === ""`) or password (`salt !== ""`). Migration to vault key format happens on first unlock with master password (v1.3.0+). | v1.0.0 |
| `mnemonicVault` | `{ version: 1, entries: [{ id, keystore }] }` | Encrypted seed phrases. `id` matches seed group ID. AES-256-GCM encrypted with vault key (`salt === ""`) or password (`salt !== ""`). Migration to vault key format happens on first unlock with master password (v1.3.0+). | v1.0.0 |

### Transaction & Request State

| Key | Shape | Description | Introduced |
|-----|-------|-------------|------------|
| `pendingTxRequests` | `PendingTxRequest[]` — `{ id, tx, origin, favicon, chainName, timestamp }` | Pending transaction requests awaiting user confirmation. 30-minute expiry. | v0.1.0 |
| `pendingSignatureRequests` | `PendingSignatureRequest[]` — `{ id, signature, origin, favicon, chainName, timestamp }` | Pending signature requests awaiting user confirmation. 30-minute expiry. | v1.0.0 |
| `txHistory` | `CompletedTransaction[]` — `{ id, status, tx, origin, chainName, chainId, txHash, ... }` | Completed transaction history. Max 50 entries. | v1.0.0 |

### Chat & Portfolio

| Key | Shape | Description | Introduced |
|-----|-------|-------------|------------|
| `chatHistory` | `Conversation[]` — `{ id, title, messages, createdAt, updatedAt }` | Chat conversations with Bankr AI. Max 50 conversations, 100 messages each. | v0.2.0 |
| `portfolioSnapshots` | `Record<address, HoldingsSnapshot[]>` | Portfolio value snapshots per address. 1-hour min interval, 8-day retention. | v1.0.0 |
| `ensIdentityCache` | `Record<address, { name, avatar, resolvedAt }>` | Resolved ENS/Basename/WNS/Mega names and avatars. 6-hour cache. | v1.0.0 |

### Transient (dynamic keys)

| Key Pattern | Shape | Description |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| `notification-{id}` | `string` (explorer URL) or `{ type, txId }` | Notification click metadata. Created on tx completion, removed on click/dismiss. |

---

## chrome.storage.sync

Syncs across Chrome profiles (if signed in). Persists across restarts.

### Core State

| Key | Shape | Description | Introduced |
|-----|-------|-------------|------------|
| `address` | `string` (`0x...`) | Active wallet address. Written by popup on account switch, read by inject.ts for provider init. | v0.1.0 |
| `displayAddress` | `string` | Display-friendly name (ENS name, custom label, or raw address). | v0.1.0 |
| `chainName` | `string` (e.g. `"Base"`) | Currently selected network. Per-tab via inject.ts, global default via popup. | v0.1.0 |
| `networksInfo` | `Record<string, { chainId, rpcUrl, explorer }>` | Supported networks config. Written by NetworksContext on first load. | v0.1.0 |
| `activeAccountId` | `string` (UUID) | Currently active account ID. Falls back to first account if missing. | v1.0.0 |
| `tabAccounts` | `Record<number, string>` (tabId → accountId) | Per-tab account overrides. Cleaned up when accounts are removed. | v1.0.0 |

### Settings

| Key | Shape | Description | Introduced |
|-----|-------|-------------|------------|
| `autoLockTimeout` | `number` (ms) | Auto-lock timeout. `0` = Never (default). Values: 0, 60000, 300000, 900000, 1800000, 3600000, 14400000. | v1.0.0 |
| `sidePanelMode` | `boolean` | Whether sidepanel mode is enabled (vs popup). | v0.2.0 |
| `sidePanelVerified` | `boolean` | Whether sidepanel has been verified for this browser. | v0.2.0 |
| `isArcBrowser` | `boolean` | Detected Arc browser — disables sidepanel. | v0.2.0 |
| `hidePortfolioValue` | `boolean` | User preference to hide USD values in portfolio. | v1.0.0 |

## chrome.storage.session

Cleared when browser closes. NOT synced. Used only for session restoration when auto-lock is "Never".

|-----|-------|-------------|------------|
| `sessionId` | `string` (UUID) | Session identifier for tracking across service worker restarts. | v1.0.0 |

## Version History

What storage each released version expects to find:

### v0.1.0 / v0.1.1 (initial releases)

```
local:  encryptedApiKey, pendingTxRequests
sync:   address, displayAddress, chainName, networksInfo
```

### v0.2.0 (chat + auto-update)

```
local:  encryptedApiKey, pendingTxRequests, chatHistory
sync:   address, displayAddress, chainName, networksInfo,
        sidePanelMode, sidePanelVerified, isArcBrowser
```

### v1.0.0 (multi-account, vault key, private keys, seed phrases)

All keys listed above. Migration from v0.1.x/v0.2.0:
- `accounts` array created from legacy `address` by `migrateFromLegacyStorage()` in background.ts
- `encryptedApiKey` → vault key system migrated on first unlock by `authHandlers.ts`

### v1.3.0 (agent password transaction signing, password type persistence)

New keys:
- `chrome.storage.session.passwordType` (optional)

Modified keys (dual-format support):
- `pkVault` entries now support vault-key encryption (`salt === ""`) in addition to password encryption (`salt !== ""`)
- `mnemonicVault` entries now support vault-key encryption (same dual-format pattern)

Migration from v1.0.0+:
- Private keys and seed phrases migrated from password encryption to vault-key encryption on first unlock with master password
- Migration is idempotent and checks format before re-encrypting
- Both formats continue to work (backward compatible)
- Agent password can sign transactions after migration completes
