# Swap Page

`/swap` route on the website. Allows users to buy any ERC20 token on Base using ETH. Not linked from the navbar — accessed directly or via shareable URLs.

## Architecture

```
User → SwapCard (UI) → useSwapQuote hook → /api/swap/price (Next.js route) → 0x API
                                          → /api/swap/quote (Next.js route) → 0x API
```

### Why server-side API routes?
- **0x API key** (`ZEROX_API_KEY`) stays server-side, never exposed to client
- **Fee params** (`swapFeeRecipient`, `swapFeeBps`, `swapFeeToken`) injected server-side so clients can't bypass or modify fees
- **Shared by both website and extension** — the extension's swap UI (`apps/extension/src/chrome/swapApi.ts`) calls the same `/api/swap/*` endpoints

### Multi-chain support
- The **website** swap page is Base-only (`SWAP_CHAIN_ID = 8453`)
- The **extension** swap supports 17 EVM chains through 0x, including Robinhood Chain. Berachain (80094), Mantle (5000), Sonic (146), and Scroll (534352) are disabled following 0x's September 21, 2026 deprecation. These remain supported wallet networks. Blast and Mode remain usable as WalletChan networks but are not swap-eligible: neither is in that Swap API table (Mode appears only in 0x's separate Cross-Chain API table). The server-side price and quote routes share `api/swap/supportedChains.ts`; extension eligibility is derived from `isSwapSupported` flags in `chainRegistry.ts`.

## 0x Integration

Uses **0x Swap API v2** with the **AllowanceHolder** flow (single-signature UX, simpler than Permit2).

### Endpoints
| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/swap/allowance-holder/price` | Indicative quote (read-only, no tx object) |
| `/swap/allowance-holder/quote` | Firm quote with executable transaction object |

### Headers
- `0x-api-key`: Server-side only
- `0x-version`: `v2`

### Fee Collection
- **Flat fee**: 0.1% (10 bps) charged on the sell token
- **Recipient**: `process.env.SWAP_FEE_RECIPIENT`
- **Params**: `swapFeeRecipient`, `swapFeeBps` (resolved per-request), `swapFeeToken` = sellToken
- Fee resolution is local and does not require an indexer or onchain call.
- The previous staking-tier resolver is retained behind the disabled `STAKING_FEE_TIERS_ENABLED` flag for possible future use.
- Fee params only added if `SWAP_FEE_RECIPIENT` env var is set
- `swapFeeToken` is hardcoded to `sellToken` server-side (not from client)

### Slippage
- `slippageBps` passed from client → API routes → 0x API
- Default: 100 (1%); an existing user-selected sync-storage value takes precedence
- Presets: 1%, 3%, 5%
- Custom input supports any value up to 50%

### Security Notes
- Never approve `transaction.to` (the Settler contract) — only approve `issues.allowance.spender`
- AllowanceHolder address on Base: `0x0000000000001fF3684f28c67538d4D072C22734`
- Native ETH address for 0x: `0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE`

## WCHAN Custom Route

ETH ↔ WCHAN swaps on Base **bypass 0x** and route through Uniswap V4's Universal Router directly. The `/api/swap/price` and `/api/swap/quote` endpoints detect this pair and quote both 0x *and* the custom route in parallel, returning whichever produces a higher `buyAmount`.

**Why a custom route**: WCHAN has its own V4 pools (a direct WETH↔WCHAN pool plus a WETH↔BNKRW + BNKRW↔WCHAN-wrap two-hop), and 0x doesn't always pick them up. We compare both quotes and pick the better output.

**Implementation:**
| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `apps/website/app/api/swap/wchanRoute.ts` | Detection (`detectWchanSwap`), quote fetcher (`fetchWchanQuote`), comparison (`compareBestRoute`), response shaping (`formatWchanResponse`) |
| `packages/wchan-swap/` | Shared package: V4 quoter ABI, pool keys, encoders (`encodeBuyWchan`, `encodeBuyWchanViaBnkrw`, `encodeSellWchan*`), slippage, addresses |
| `apps/website/lib/wchan-swap/` | Thin wrapper that forwards to the shared package — used by the website's own `/swap-wchan` page (which calls the V4 quoter directly client-side) |

**Routes:**
- `direct` — single-hop WETH↔WCHAN (UR commands: `WRAP_ETH → V4_SWAP → SWEEP`)
- `via-bnkrw` — two-hop WETH↔BNKRW + BNKRW↔WCHAN wrap (V4 actions: `SWAP_EXACT_IN → SETTLE → TAKE_ALL`)

The chosen route is exposed in the response as `wchanRoute: "direct" | "via-bnkrw"` and `routeSource: "wchan-v4"`.

### Gas budgeting (the hard part)

Universal Router + V4 with hooks is **systematically under-estimated** by every "cheap" gas-estimation method we tried. Specifically:

1. **The V4 quoter's `gasEstimate` only covers `PoolManager.swap` itself.** It misses UR routing overhead, `WRAP_ETH`/`SWEEP` commands, hook callbacks, and (for `via-bnkrw`) the BNKRW↔WCHAN wrap call entirely. Heuristics like "quoter gas + fixed overhead × buffer" produced values that OOG'd onchain.

2. **`eth_simulateV1` consistently under-reports** for V4-with-hooks calls — observed ~25% below real onchain need on Base, regardless of provider. (Likely a quirk in how simulators account for dynamic hook gas vs. real EVM execution.) Trusting `simulateV1 × 1.2` would silently downgrade a correct API gas value at signing time.

**What the API does (`wchanRoute.ts:estimateTxGas`):**

1. Encode the actual UR tx **with `minAmountOut = 0`** so simulation isn't tripped by pool-state drift between the quote and the estimation call. The on-the-wire response tx uses the user's real slippage.
2. Run `eth_estimateGas` against the encoded tx. Try the configured RPC first, then `base.llamarpc.com` as a fallback. For each, try **with** state override (taker balance set to 100 ETH so callers without funds can still simulate) and **without** (some providers reject the override param). First success wins.
3. Apply **1.5× buffer** to the result.
4. Floor to a hardcoded minimum: **`FALLBACK_GAS_DIRECT = 700_000`** / **`FALLBACK_GAS_VIA_BNKRW = 1_200_000`**. The floor catches the case where the buffered estimate is suspiciously low and provides a safety net when every RPC attempt fails.

Unused gas refunds on Base, so over-budgeting is cheap; an OOG revert is much worse.

**What the extension does (`MultiTxGasEstimateDisplay.tsx`):**

The extension's local pre-confirmation gas estimation runs `eth_simulateV1` (then bytecode injection, then per-call `eth_estimateGas`) and applies a 20% buffer. For UR/V4 swaps, the simulator under-reports — so without a guard, the local estimate would replace the API's correctly-budgeted gas at signing.

The component now **floors each estimate to the dapp/API-provided `tx.gas`**: `gasLimit = max(simulated × buffer, dapp_tx_gas)`. Concretely, when the API hands the extension `tx.gas = 1_200_000` and `eth_simulateV1` returns ~520k → 624k after buffer, we keep 1_200_000. The user can still edit downward in the picker if they want, but the default never silently downgrades a correct API value.

**Knobs & references:**
- `apps/website/app/api/swap/wchanRoute.ts` — `tryEstimateOnce`, `estimateTxGas`, `formatWchanResponse`
- `packages/wchan-swap/src/quotes.ts` — the V4 quoter call (note: returns `gasEstimate` alongside `amountOut`, but we no longer rely on it for our own budget — kept on `WchanQuote` for completeness)
- `apps/extension/src/components/MultiTxGasEstimateDisplay.tsx` — see the `floored` mapping in the `isNonAtomic` branch

> **Lesson (broader than swaps):** Whenever an API or dapp ships a transaction with a `gas` field, the extension's local estimation must **floor** to it, never replace it. Local sims are an *additional* signal, not a source of truth for already-budgeted txs. Worth applying the same floor pattern to the other estimation paths if a similar regression shows up.

## Key UI Behaviors

### Quote Fetching
- **Debounced auto-fetch** (500ms) when inputs change — no "Get Quote" button needed
- **No periodic refresh** — minimizes API calls (free tier)
- Quote clears automatically when token or amount changes

### Swap Flow (SwapButton)
1. Switch chain to Base (if needed)
2. Approve token (if ERC20 sell — not needed for ETH)
3. Fetch firm quote from `/api/swap/quote`
4. Send transaction via `sendTransactionAsync`
5. Wait for confirmation, show BaseScan link

### URL Sync
- Token address synced to `?token=` query param
- Read via `window.location.search` on mount (avoids `useSearchParams` + Suspense flash)
- Updated via `window.history.replaceState` on input change
- Enables shareable swap links: `/swap?token=0x...`

### Layout
- Token address input (resolves name + symbol badge)
- "You Pay" ETH input with balance display + Max button
- Down arrow (blue, absolutely positioned between fields)
- "You Receive" read-only output field with slippage gear icon
- Collapsible quote details (min received → expand for fees + route)
- Swap button (red, stays visible during loading with 85% opacity)

### Slippage Settings
- Compact trigger: `"5% slippage ⚙"` text above output field
- Popover (200px wide): 3 preset buttons + custom % input
- Changing slippage triggers quote re-fetch
