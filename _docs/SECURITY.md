# WalletChan Security Guide

This document is the security reference for the WalletChan Chrome extension. It defines the threat model, lists every security-sensitive code path, and provides checklists for verifying that changes do not introduce vulnerabilities.

The current Privacy Pools implementation status, recent real-proof regression,
and pending release gates are recorded in
[`PRIVACY_POOLS_HANDOFF.md`](./PRIVACY_POOLS_HANDOFF.md).

**When to read this**: Before every commit that touches extension code. Claude (or any reviewer) should verify changes against the relevant checklists below.

## Threat Model

### What We Protect

| Secret          | Storage                                                                                          | In-Memory Cache                                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Master password | Never stored by current sessions. Released encrypted password-Never envelopes are accepted only as migration input; fallback-browser residue is removed across capability upgrades. | `cachedPassword` in `session/inMemoryCache.ts` via the `sessionCache.ts` facade |
| Agent password  | Never stored directly (encrypts vault key)                                                       | Not cached separately (same `cachedPassword` slot) |
| Password type   | `chrome.storage.session` (for session restoration)                                               | `cachedPasswordType` in `session/inMemoryCache.ts` |
| Passkey PRF output | Never stored. Produced by WebAuthn in a trusted extension page and sent over extension-internal runtime messaging for immediate service-worker wrap/unwrap; never forwarded to content scripts, webpages, or inpage code | Not cached after use |
| Bankr API key   | `encryptedApiKeyVault` (AES-256-GCM via vault key) or `encryptedApiKey` (legacy, password-based) | `cachedApiKey` in `session/inMemoryCache.ts`       |
| Private keys    | `pkVault` entries (AES-256-GCM via vault key or password, indicated by `salt` field)             | `cachedVault` in `session/inMemoryCache.ts`        |
| Seed phrases    | V2 `mnemonicVault` entries encrypted by a dedicated mnemonic key; V1 entries encrypted by the master password (plus read-only transitional shared-vault compatibility) | `cachedMnemonicKey` only in master/password or V2 passkey sessions; never in agent sessions. Reveal still requires explicit master-password verification |
| Vault key       | `encryptedVaultKeyMaster` / `encryptedVaultKeyAgent` (PBKDF2-wrapped); native password/passkey sessions also hold one encrypted, factor-bound general-key capability split across session/local storage | `cachedVaultKey` in `session/inMemoryCache.ts`     |
| Mnemonic key    | Master wrapper in V2 `mnemonicVault.masterWrappedKey`; independent V2 passkey wrapper in `passkeyUnlock.wrappedMnemonicKey` | `cachedMnemonicKey` as a non-extractable CryptoKey in password-master and fresh V2 passkey-assertion sessions only; it is deliberately absent after any cold passkey restoration |
| Privacy Pools phrase | `privacyVault.recovery`, encrypted by a dedicated privacy key with key-ID-bound AES-GCM AAD | Decrypted transiently for background derivation/rescan. It leaves the service worker only through the explicit main-password-gated trusted Settings reveal route, never through Private-mode initialization, ordinary Shield, or page/provider routes. |
| Privacy key | At least one master or purpose-separated passkey wrapper inside `privacyVault`; normal setup stores both. A native unified master session may include the exact verified key inside its split AES-GCM envelope; agent sessions never do. | `cachedPrivacyKey` as a non-extractable CryptoKey plus a zeroed-on-teardown 32-byte rewrap/session copy in master-password, matching passkey, and restored master sessions only; never in agent sessions |
| Privacy operation details | IndexedDB Shield, commitment, Unshield, ragequit, and private-portfolio records encrypted by the dedicated privacy key with complete-summary/key-ID/revision or record-header AES-GCM AAD | Note linkage, secrets, proof inputs, relayer payloads, calldata, and stored balance/price values remain background-only; the trusted renderer receives aggregates, bounded activity, and bounded decrypted chart points only |

### Trust Boundaries

```
UNTRUSTED                          TRUSTED (extension context)
-----------                        ---------------------------
Webpage JS (dapp)                  Background service worker
  |                                  - sessionCache.ts (session facade)
  |                                  - session/inMemoryCache.ts (credentials)
  v                                  - auth/walletUnlock.ts / authHandlers.ts
inpage.js (runs in page context)     - txHandlers.ts (signing)
  |                                  - crypto.ts / vaultCrypto.ts
  v
inject.ts (content script bridge)  Extension UI (popup/sidepanel)
  |                                  - Same origin as background
  v                                  - Communicates via chrome.runtime
background.ts (five-line entrypoint) → background/bootstrap.ts
  → background/messagePipeline.ts + background/composition/
  → privacy/protocol/ (pinned crypto/artifact boundary; no UI import)
  → privacy/deployment/ (compile-time-selected fixed-chain public-RPC identity check; no account input)
  → privacy/deposit/ (public quote + master-only non-submittable review preparation)
  → privacy/operations/ (encrypted durable operation; no signer/submission import)
  → privacy/prover/ (fixed-input offscreen worker; no secret release)
```

**Key principle**: The webpage and content script are untrusted. All validation
and routine secret handling happens in the background service worker. Private
keys and seed phrases reach only the exact trusted WalletChan UI document after
the corresponding explicit, master-password-gated reveal action; they are
never sent to content scripts, inpage code, webpages, or unrelated extension
documents.

Native `chrome.storage.session` is readable by the service worker and trusted
extension-origin pages, not only the worker; content scripts are excluded by
default. A trusted extension-page compromise can therefore read both halves of
a native restorable-session envelope and is inside the secret-bearing trust boundary. A
content-script compromise can read only the random local `sessionEncKey` half,
which is insufficient without the browser-session ciphertext.

## Encryption Specifications

| Parameter      | Value                                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Algorithm      | AES-256-GCM (authenticated encryption)                  |
| Key derivation | PBKDF2-SHA256                                           |
| Iterations     | 600,000                                                 |
| Salt           | 16 bytes (random per encryption)                        |
| IV             | 12 bytes (random per encryption)                        |
| Vault key      | 256-bit random (generated once, encrypted per-password) |

New master and agent passwords are accepted only when they are 8 to 256
characters and do not match the common-password denylist in
`constants/securityPolicy.ts`. This creation policy is enforced in both the UI
and the background onboarding, agent-factor, and master-rotation boundaries.
Existing-password unlock and verification deliberately omit the minimum so a
legacy wallet with a shorter password cannot be stranded.

**Files**: the stable `crypto.ts` and `cryptoUtils.ts` facades cover the `cryptography/` audit domain (`types.ts` for the released envelope, `base64.ts` for bounded codecs, `passwordKey.ts` for fixed PBKDF2 policy, `passwordCipher.ts` for legacy AES-GCM records, `vaultKey.ts` for 32-byte vault-key wrapping/direct encryption, and `credentialStorage.ts` for vault-first legacy-compatible Bankr lookup). The policy-free `vaultCrypto.ts` facade covers the `vault/` audit domain (`entryCrypto.ts` for released password/vault-key transforms, `accountIntegrity.ts` for local key binding, `generalIntegrity.ts` for general-key recovery proof, `recordCodec.ts` for bounded released-V1 decoding and the unique-ID mutation gate, `repository.ts` for exact `pkVault` V1 storage, and `operations.ts` for serialized mutation/hydration/migration preparation). The stable `mnemonicStorage.ts` facade covers the `mnemonic/` audit domain (`record.ts`, `crypto.ts`, `repository.ts`, `operations.ts`, and `recovery.ts` for encrypted-vault compatibility; `derivation.ts` for pure BIP39/BIP44 operations; `masterAccess.ts` for the call-stack-only master capability; `integrity.ts` for master-recovery/account proof; and `addressPreview.ts`, `accountPersistence.ts`, and `accountHandlers.ts` for seed-account workflows). The `passkey/` audit domain contains `record.ts`, `keyWrapping.ts`, `repository.ts`, `status.ts`, `setup.ts`, `hydration.ts`, and `removal.ts`; `passkeyUnlockCrypto.ts` and `passkeyUnlock.ts` remain stable facades. Stable `secretRevealHandlers.ts` and `masterAuthorization.ts` facades cover `secrets/revealHandlers.ts` and `secrets/masterAuthorization.ts`, where plaintext release remains lock-held, epoch-bound, master-only, and revalidated after asynchronous reads.

The `privacy/` audit domain owns the exact `privacyVault` record, dedicated-key
encryption and wrappers, repository, lifecycle preparation, and idempotent
first-Private-mode identity initialization.

See [`SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md`](./SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md) for the enforced
dependency direction, background-message audience contract, critical operation
shape, compatibility-facade policy, and behavioral test requirements used to
decompose these modules for external audit.

## Vault Key System Architecture

WalletChan uses a **two-tier encryption** system (vault key wrapping) to enable multiple passwords to decrypt the same data without key duplication:

```
Master Password → PBKDF2 (600k) → Decrypt encryptedVaultKeyMaster → General Vault Key (256-bit)
Agent Password  → PBKDF2 (600k) → Decrypt encryptedVaultKeyAgent  → Same General Vault Key
Passkey PRF     → HKDF("vault") → Decrypt wrappedVaultKey          → Same General Vault Key
                                         ↓
                  General Vault Key → AES-256-GCM → Decrypt:
                                    - encryptedApiKeyVault
                                    - pkVault entries (salt === "")

Master Password → PBKDF2 (600k) → Decrypt V2 masterWrappedKey ┐
Passkey PRF     → HKDF("mnemonic") → Decrypt wrappedMnemonicKey├→ Dedicated Mnemonic Key
Agent Password / General Vault Key ────────────────────────────┘  (no access)
                                                                  ↓
                                      V2 mnemonicVault entries with per-group AAD

Master Password → PBKDF2 (600k) → AES-256-GCM → V1 mnemonicVault entries

Master Password → PBKDF2 ───────────────────────────────┐
Passkey PRF     → HKDF("privacy") ──────────────────────┼→ Dedicated Privacy Key
Agent / General / Mnemonic keys ────────────────────────┘  (no access)
                At least one wrapper is required; normal setup stores both.
                                                           ↓
                                      privacyVault recovery with key-ID AAD
```

Passkey setup requests PRF evaluation as part of the user-verifying WebAuthn
registration ceremony. When registration returns `prf.results.first`, that
output is used directly to wrap the vault key; otherwise setup performs a
user-verifying assertion to obtain the same credential-bound PRF output.

### Storage Format Detection

**Vault-key encrypted** (current, v1.3.0+):

- `salt === ""` in keystore object
- Encrypted directly with vault key (no PBKDF2 derivation)
- Both master and agent passwords can decrypt (via vault key)

**Password encrypted** (legacy, pre-v1.3.0):

- `salt !== ""` (16-byte base64 salt)
- Encrypted with PBKDF2-derived key from password
- Only the specific password that encrypted it can decrypt
- Supported for backward compatibility during migration

### Migration Strategy

**Automatic migration** on first unlock after v1.3.0 upgrade:

1. `auth/walletUnlock.ts` authenticates the master password and invokes
   `auth/legacyVaultKeyMigration.ts` → `migrateToVaultKeySystem()`
2. Generate 256-bit random vault key
3. Encrypt vault key with master password → save to `encryptedVaultKeyMaster`
4. Re-encrypt API key with vault key → save to `encryptedApiKeyVault`
5. Re-encrypt all private keys with vault key → update `pkVault` entries (`salt: ""`)
6. Leave V1 seed phrases master-password encrypted. Successful passkey setup later converts them atomically to a V2 dedicated-mnemonic-key vault.

**Partial migration detection**: If the general vault-key system exists (`encryptedVaultKeyMaster` present) but private keys remain password-encrypted (`salt !== ""`), migration is completed on the next master-password unlock. A partial `encryptedVaultKeyMaster` + legacy `encryptedApiKey` state is likewise recovered and atomically converted on master unlock; passkey/agent sessions refuse to report a half-unlocked Bankr wallet until that password-only ciphertext is migrated. Authentication hydration and credential updates share one operation lock through their final cache commit so an older key read cannot overwrite a concurrent newer credential in memory. V1 mnemonics deliberately remain supported until explicit passkey setup converts the complete vault in one commit.

### Password Type Persistence (v1.3.0+)

To maintain agent password access control guards across service worker restarts:

**Storage**: `chrome.storage.session.passwordType` (stored alongside session password)

**Restoration**: When `tryRestoreSession()` succeeds, `passwordType` is restored to `cachedPasswordType`, ensuring operations remain blocked for agent password sessions even after restart. Restoration shares the serialized auth-transition queue with manual lock and factor/password mutations, so an in-flight restore cannot resurrect credentials after a newer lock. Manual lock also sets a worker-local restoration barrier before teardown; if both durable-half deletions fail, every open UI receives `walletLockFailedExternal` and later routine restore attempts in that worker fail closed until fresh explicit authentication.

**Critical**: Without password type persistence, agent password users could temporarily bypass guards (reveal private keys, change settings) after service worker restart until manual lock/unlock. This is now mitigated in v1.3.0+.

## Agent Password Access Control

The agent password model restricts what operations are available when the wallet is unlocked with the agent (secondary) password vs. the master password.

### Access Matrix

| Operation                        | Master | Agent       | Guard Location                                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Unlock wallet                    | Yes    | Yes         | `auth/walletUnlock.ts` + `auth/sessionHydration.ts`                             |
| Sign/send transactions           | Yes    | Yes         | `txHandlers.ts`                                                                |
| Sign messages                    | Yes    | Yes         | `txHandlers.ts`                                                                |
| Add/remove/confirm cross-dapp batch | Yes | Yes         | `crossDappBatchHandlers.ts` (no extra gating — same as single tx submission)   |
| Canonical WalletChan EIP-7702 batch authorization | Yes | Yes | `delegation/authorityPolicy.ts` (stable `delegatedAuthorityPolicy.ts` facade) - routine default delegate remains agent-capable |
| Install a custom/non-default EIP-7702 delegate | Yes | **BLOCKED** | `delegation/authorityPolicy.ts` at initiation and again at the raw-send boundary |
| Approve an ERC-7715 delegated permission | Yes | **BLOCKED** | `erc7715/confirmation.ts` + grant-storage commit guard                          |
| Revoke EIP-7702 / ERC-7715 authority | Yes | Yes | Revocation handlers use the routine signing policy because they reduce authority |
| Reveal private key               | Yes    | **BLOCKED** | `background/secretManagementRouter.ts` transport + `secrets/revealHandlers.ts` |
| Change API key/address           | Yes    | **BLOCKED** | `auth/bankrCredentialUpdate.ts` + verified atomic account/credential commit; legacy cached-password-only mutation fails closed |
| Change master password           | Yes    | **BLOCKED** | `auth/masterPasswordRotation.ts` - `handleChangePassword()`                    |
| Add Bankr account (with API key) | Yes    | **BLOCKED** | `background/accountManagementRouter.ts` + `auth/bankrCredentialUpdate.ts`      |
| Add private key account          | Yes    | **BLOCKED** | `background/accountManagementRouter.ts` + the private-key vault boundary       |
| Add impersonator account         | Yes    | **BLOCKED** | `background/accountManagementRouter.ts`                                        |
| Add seed phrase group            | Yes    | **BLOCKED** | `background/accountManagementRouter.ts` → `mnemonic/accountHandlers.ts`        |
| Derive seed account              | Yes    | **BLOCKED** | `background/accountManagementRouter.ts` → `mnemonic/accountHandlers.ts`        |
| Reveal seed phrase               | Yes    | **BLOCKED** | `background/secretManagementRouter.ts` transport + `secrets/revealHandlers.ts` |
| Remove account                   | Yes    | **BLOCKED** | `background/accountManagementRouter.ts` + account-removal privacy boundary     |
| Initialize Privacy Pools recovery | Yes | **BLOCKED** | `background/privacyRouter.ts` → `privacy/identity.ts`; already-ready status is non-secret and does not reopen the vault |
| Run Privacy Pools readiness check | Yes | Yes | Fixed public active-profile deployment fields plus packaged proof fixtures only; no account, phrase, balance, signing, or transaction input |
| Run Privacy Pools prover QA self-test | Yes | Yes | Trusted-UI-only route returns aggregate self-test timing only; no proof, signal, fixture, input, phrase, or wallet key |
| Quote an active-chain Shield amount | Yes | Yes | Read-only exact-account public balance/fee/gas simulation; impersonators rejected and no intent, note, signer, or submission exists |
| Prepare an active-chain Shield review | Yes | **BLOCKED** | Decrypts recovery only under the wallet-secret lock and a live master epoch; exact-shape validation pins the accepted public gross quote to the entered net amount and produces a non-persisted, non-submittable background intent with no calldata or commitment material returned |
| Persist an active-chain Shield operation | Yes | **BLOCKED** | `privacy/operations/prepare.ts` repeats deployment/quote/account/master checks, verifies the accepted public gross quote pin against the entered net amount, requires the authenticated dedicated privacy capability from a password or fresh matching biometric master session, atomically reserves a distinct index, and encrypts sensitive operation details before the trusted confirmation request exists; phrase reveal remains explicit-main-password-only |
| Confirm/submit active-chain Shield | Yes | **BLOCKED** | Trusted account-pinned pending request; encrypted intent, deployment, account, and master epoch are rechecked at confirmation and the final effect boundary. Sepolia supports private-key/seed-phrase/Ledger but blocks Bankr; mainnet also supports Bankr. Ledger keeps the prompt pending through device approval and begins the privacy effect only at the final pre-broadcast boundary. Impersonators never submit. |
| Prepare/submit private Unshield | Yes | **BLOCKED** | Wallet-wide privacy authority: no active public account is accepted in the request or consulted during quote/proof work. `privacy/withdrawals/` validates the dedicated master capability, signed relayer economics, roots, membership, proof signals, auth epoch, and nullifier immediately before POST. |
| Preview public Shield recovery | Yes | **BLOCKED** | `privacyPreviewRagequit` requires live master authorization and returns every locally verified ragequittable deposit as only a bounded opaque commitment-record ID, timestamp, account metadata, source-operation binding, and current whole-commitment amount; a valid lookup with none returns an empty collection. Preview does not start the disposable global-event backfill; preparation still fail-closes by checking the selected current nullifier onchain before proof generation and again inside the final claim. Preview may materialize already-indexed encrypted commitment state but creates no proof, recovery intent, claim, pending request, or external effect. |
| Prepare/confirm public Shield recovery | Yes | **BLOCKED** | `privacy/ragequit/` requires the original depositor, repeats every selected opaque commitment ID plus optional transaction-detail source binding, and rejects duplicates, mixed accounts, stale status, or account/source/amount drift. A single exit uses the normal pinned request for all four signing account types; 2–8 same-account exits use one immutable EIP-7702/ERC-7821/Bankr atomic batch whose operation-ID/call order and encrypted claims are rechecked at the final effect boundary. Ledger batches fail closed and exit one commitment per device-signed transaction. Impersonators never submit. |
| Reveal/restore/rescan Privacy Pools recovery | Yes | **BLOCKED** | `background/privacyRecoveryRouter.ts` requires the exact trusted UI plus explicit main-password proof or a live master epoch; plaintext reveal is confined to the Settings leaf and restore resets only rebuildable privacy state |
| Initiate token transfer          | Yes    | Yes         | `txHandlers.ts` - creates PendingTxRequest                                     |
| Reset extension                  | Yes    | **BLOCKED** | `background/resetRouter.ts` requires an explicit boolean Shield-loss acknowledgement when Shield data exists, then uses the exact `storage/resetManifest.ts` |
| Set/remove agent password        | Yes    | **BLOCKED** | `auth/agentFactorHandlers.ts`                                                   |
| Set/remove passkey unlock        | Yes    | **BLOCKED** | Stable `passkeyUnlock.ts` facade over focused status/setup/hydration/removal boundaries; setup/removal require master authorization |

### How Guards Work

Every blocked operation resolves the live password type from `sessionCache.ts`
and requires a master session before executing sensitive logic. Persistent
delegated-authority changes additionally capture the auth epoch and re-check
both that epoch and the live master type at their grant-storage/raw-send
linearization point. These guards are **backend-enforced** (defense-in-depth),
independent of UI-level hiding/disabling.

V2 biometric unlock hydrates `passwordType: "master"`, the cached general vault
key, and the separate cached mnemonic key,
but intentionally does not cache the plaintext master password. Operations
whose cryptography needs only those capabilities (private-key/seed-phrase account
creation, seed account derivation, and Bankr API credential creation/update)
accept them as a valid master session. V1 passkeys existed only in unreleased
local development builds. Their decoder retains routine signing compatibility
to avoid stranding developer profiles, while the UI intentionally requires V2
reconfiguration before every new local-account setup path. Seed/private-key
reveal, master-password rotation, agent-password wrapping, and passkey removal
still require explicit master-password verification. Agent-factor setup accepts
a fresh or cold-restored passkey master session only after the user separately
enters a master password that proves complete general and V2 mnemonic recovery.
Agent sessions
can unwrap only the general vault key for routine signing, so every seed operation
is guarded by the background-resolved password type before mnemonic decryption.
Routine transaction/message signing and canonical WalletChan EIP-7702 batch
authorization remain agent-capable. Issuing a reusable ERC-7715 capability or
installing a non-default EIP-7702 delegate is master-only; revoking either kind
of authority remains agent-capable.

**Pattern**:

```typescript
// At the TOP of the handler, before any logic
if (getPasswordType() === "agent") {
  return { success: false, error: "This operation requires master password" };
}
```

## Security-Sensitive Message Handlers

These are the message handlers composed by `background.ts` and its focused
transport routers that touch secrets, modify accounts, or have destructive
effects. Each must be audited when changed.

### External provider ingress policy

Untrusted page and WalletConnect input share the effect-free validators under
`chrome/provider/`. `messageValidation.ts` caps the complete injected envelope
before background dispatch. Focused validators separately freeze request-id
syntax, URL length/policy, transaction calldata and uint256 quantities,
signature method/signer/payload shape, `wallet_sendCalls` count/data/value
limits, and EIP-3085/EIP-747 metadata. WalletConnect and batch intake call the
same payload validators directly, so they do not rely on another transport
having validated first. `chainBoundary.ts` never coerces arbitrary values and
requires the requested chain to equal the content-script-attested active chain
for every state-changing injected route. No provider-policy module may access
Chrome storage, fetch, credentials, secrets, signing, or broadcasting.

### Secret-Exposing Handlers

| Handler             | What It Exposes                                               | Guard                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `getCachedApiKey`   | `background/bankrCredentialRouter.ts` returns plaintext API key to caller | Exact extension page sender, master session, auto-lock timeout checked |
| `revealPrivateKey`  | Returns plaintext private key                                 | Requires password verification + blocks agent password |
| `getCachedPassword` | Returns `hasCachedPassword` boolean (not the password itself) | `wallet-ui` audience in `background/messageAccessPolicy.ts` |

### Secret-Modifying Handlers

| Handler                            | What It Modifies                                                                                                             | Guard                                      |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `saveApiKeyWithCachedPassword`     | Legacy compatibility message; returns an error and performs no mutation so a credential-only update cannot bypass account binding | Extension-only; fail closed                |
| `saveBankrApiKeyAndAddress`        | `background/bankrCredentialRouter.ts` cryptographically verifies a harmless `/wallet/sign` challenge against the proposed address, then atomically overwrites the encrypted API key and Bankr account row before best-effort mirrors | Master session and prepared auth epoch required; agent blocked |
| `changePassword`                   | Re-verifies the current master password; proves the general wrapper recovers the non-empty Bankr credential and every local key with the correct account address, and proves the V2 mnemonic wrapper recovers every valid phrase/seed account before clearing factors; atomically re-wraps general/mnemonic keys, re-encrypts V1 phrases, and completes residual API/`pkVault` migrations | Agent password blocked |
| `addBankrAccount`                  | Verifies the API signer/address, atomically commits credential + row, and enforces one wallet-wide Bankr account for new adds | Master session required; agent blocked     |
| `addPrivateKeyAccount`             | Adds new entry to encrypted private key vault using the cached vault key after biometric/master unlock, or password fallback for legacy wallets | Agent password blocked                     |
| `addSeedPhraseGroup`               | `mnemonic/accountHandlers.ts` creates/imports a seed group using the cached V2 mnemonic key after biometric/master unlock, or master-password encryption for V1 wallets | Agent password blocked                     |
| `deriveSeedAccount`                | `mnemonic/accountHandlers.ts` decrypts V2 with the cached mnemonic key (or V1 with the master password) and stores derived keys in `pkVault` | Agent password blocked                     |

### Account-Modifying Handlers

| Handler                    | Effect                                           | Guard                              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| `removeAccount`            | Runs Shield safety before dapp revocation and again inside the final account/secret lock, then revokes exact-origin grants and deletes the reference; never exposes the fallback account as an implicit replacement | Agent blocked; unresolved/ambiguous Shield operations, active ragequit, unspent commitments, or unverifiable privacy identity block removal |
| `reorderAccounts`           | Reorders account metadata without changing account identity or secrets; validates an exact ID permutation under the shared account lock | `wallet-ui` audience policy |
| `setActiveAccount`         | Changes active account + updates storage address | `wallet-ui` audience policy |
| `setTabAccount`            | Validates account selection; connected/pending dapp tabs retain an override and refresh the shared fallback, while ordinary tabs update only that fallback and clear stale overrides | `wallet-ui` audience policy |
| `updateAccountDisplayName` | Changes display name                             | `wallet-ui` audience policy |

Account metadata uses a stable `accountStorage.ts` facade over independently
reviewable repository, selection, Bankr, local/view-only, seed-account, and
seed-group modules. The split does not change the `accounts`, `activeAccountId`,
`tabAccounts`, or `seedGroups` storage schemas. Bankr metadata and its prepared
encrypted credential still commit in one local-storage write; secret vault
material remains outside the account metadata domain.

### Destructive Handlers

| Handler          | Effect                      | Guard                                         |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `resetExtension` | After the exact Shield-risk acknowledgement gate, wipes wallet identity state, pending queues, WalletConnect routing, cross-dapp batches, tx history, wallet portfolio state, transient result keys, all Privacy Pools IndexedDB databases, and session auth state via the stable `walletResetStorage.ts` facade plus explicit database deletion | Agent password blocked |
| `lockWallet`     | Clears all in-memory caches, revokes the durable restorable-session recovery half first, then independently clears the browser-session half. Either confirmed deletion is sufficient; if both fail the UI blocks on an explicit retry state instead of claiming success. Successful lock tells open UI surfaces to suppress their biometric auto-prompt in renderer memory. | None needed (user-initiated, non-destructive) |
| `clearTxHistory` | Deletes transaction history | `wallet-ui` audience policy |

### Extension-Only UI Reads and Actions

`background/messageAccessPolicy.ts` is the exhaustive audience manifest for the
main `background/messagePipeline.ts` router. Any message owned by popup/sidepanel/onboarding UI
that reads wallet state, account metadata, chat history, pending-request
details, transaction history/status, session/auth status, clear-signing
preferences/cache, or mutates extension-only state must be classified exactly
once as `wallet-ui`. Provider-facing routes must be deliberately classified as
`provider` and still pass external envelope validation. A router case without a
classification fails the security test suite. Current examples include:

The gate uses `isTrustedWalletUiSender()` and accepts only the top-level
`index.html` and `onboarding.html` documents at WalletChan's exact extension
scheme + host. It does **not** trust an arbitrary `chrome-extension://` or
`moz-extension://` URL. The web-accessible ENS documents (`browse.html`,
`interstitial.html`, `ens-error.html`, `setup-kubo.html`) are authorized only
for their exact message/page combinations in
`ensBrowsing/senderAuthorization.ts`; `ensBrowsing/handlers.ts` remains only
the stable message-entry facade. The top-level `browse.html` launcher may call
`ens-list-connected-dapps`, which returns only a 24-entry display projection of
`dappPermissions`: canonical origin-derived hostname, bounded title, sanitized
public raster URL, and last-used timestamp. Embedded launcher frames, ordinary
sites, and other extension pages fail authorization before permission storage
is read. The projection excludes account addresses and unrecognized stored
fields. These documents
cannot call wallet UI, account, auth, or secret handlers. The exact top-level
`browse.html` document may also call `ens-revoke-connected-dapp` with one
HTTP(S) origin. That route normalizes the origin and delegates to the complete
dapp revocation lifecycle: permission deletion, pending-request cancellation,
matching-tab account cleanup, page notification, and a permission-change
broadcast. It cannot grant access, choose an account, reveal account metadata,
or delete the separate non-secret favorite record. Connected favorites extend
the existing `ensBookmarks` record only with a normalized HTTP(S) origin; an
invalid or non-HTTP(S) `launchUrl` is discarded before persistence or launch.
Favorite reordering may additionally store a numeric display-only `sortOrder`
on those same non-secret records. Reordering neither changes the launch target
nor grants, revokes, or reads dapp permissions or account data.
`explorer.html` is separately web-accessible so the content script can embed a
style-isolated decoder inside configured explorer `/tx/<hash>` Input Data
sections. WalletChan is selected by default, so the content script creates the
document as soon as a supported transaction page and native Input Data section
are recognized. The resulting RPC and decoder traffic remains public-metadata
only. It is never a trusted wallet UI: the exact document is accepted only by
`explorerTransaction/messageRouter.ts`, which requires its Chrome-attested tab
URL to remain a configured explorer page. Top-level instances therefore fail
authorization. That router
re-resolves Chrome-attested `sender.tab.url` against normalized built-in/custom
explorers, binds metadata requests to the matched chain ID, and permits only
calldata descriptor lookup, public token metadata, and a bounded random-token
resize/dismiss relay back to the top-frame content script. It cannot read
accounts, history, sessions, credentials, pending requests, or secrets, and it
exposes no signing or submission effect.
The same exact top-level launcher may call `ens-search-dapp-directory` with one
user-entered query. The background trims and caps it at 120 characters, sends
only that query to the exact DefiLlama HTTPS search endpoint, and applies a
5-second deadline, 64 KiB response ceiling, redirect rejection, omitted
credentials/referrer, and JSON validation. Its renderer projection is capped at
eight records and retains only a bounded name, credential-free HTTPS route,
derived hostname, and sanitized raster logo URL. No account, permission,
credential, browsing-history, or resolver-cache data is sent to DefiLlama. The
DefiLlama key is an intentionally public client key shared with the website OS
build, is confined to the background bundle at runtime, and grants no wallet
authority. Direct launcher navigation likewise accepts only credential-free
HTTPS URLs up to 2,048 characters; ordinary HTTP input fails closed.
The trusted wallet connection screen reuses the same bounded directory client
through `getDappConnectionReputation`, but it cannot choose the queried
hostname. The wallet-UI message carries only a bounded pending request ID; the
service worker resolves that ID from `pendingDappConnectionRequests` and sends
its Chrome-attested hostname to the fixed first-party reputation endpoint and
DefiLlama. A renderer-supplied hostname is ignored. The first-party service may
return a custom trusted-domain match from its validated, checked-in allowlist;
subdomain inheritance requires an explicit `allowAllSubdomains` flag and uses a
dot-boundary suffix match. An exact DefiLlama route-hostname comparison is a
second independent positive display signal, including when the negative-list
request is unavailable. Neither positive signal overrides a MetaMask
block/fuzzy result.
The exact launcher may also call `ens-cache-browser-image` with a public image
URL returned by the directory or connected-dapp projection. This is a distinct
message from trusted wallet UI image requests and exposes only the existing
avatar cache's public-HTTPS validation, redirect/size/MIME limits, raster
decode, and WebP re-encode result. Embedded launchers and ordinary sites cannot
invoke it, and the renderer never receives remote bytes or assigns the remote
URL directly to `<img>`.
Suggestion navigation uses the separate `ens-open-dapp-url` route. Only the
exact top-level `browse.html` launcher may invoke it, and the background accepts
at most 2,048 characters, reparses the URL, requires HTTPS with a hostname,
rejects embedded credentials, and creates one active tab. Embedded launchers,
ordinary sites, HTTP URLs, and malformed values cannot use the route. The
adjacent star action writes only the existing non-secret, origin-normalized
bookmark projection and never grants or changes dapp permissions.
`popup-wake`, `ui-keepalive`, and onboarding worker-only ports use the same
sender check so a content script or embedded web-accessible page cannot forge
wallet presence. Each main wallet document creates one random,
renderer-memory-only `surfaceId`, registers it exactly once, and includes it in
the secret-free 20-second heartbeat. The background rejects malformed,
duplicate, or changing IDs and tracks a bounded ID set. A registered wallet
surface pauses finite inactivity expiry; its last disconnect starts the timer.
Authenticated heartbeat/lease metadata lets the same renderer prove continuous
presence after a worker restart, while a new renderer ID cannot revive an
expired session. Onboarding uses a separate heartbeat and never holds an auth
lease. Manual lock and revoking auth transitions ignore presence and remain
immediate.

| Handler Class | Examples | Why Extension-Only |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Account/session reads and ordering | `getAccounts`, `reorderAccounts`, `getTabAccount`, `getSeedGroups`, `isWalletUnlocked`, `isApiKeyCached`, `tryRestoreSession`, `getPasswordType`, `getAutoLockTimeout` | Avoid exposing wallet/account/session state or allowing webpages to mutate wallet UI ordering. |
| Transaction/history UI | `getTxHistory`, `getTxHistoryPage`, `getTxHistoryItem`, `getTransactionCalldata`, `resolveHistoryNftMetadata`, `getTransactionNonce`, `prepareTransactionReplacement`, `getProcessingTxs`, `getFailedTxResult`, `checkPendingTxReceipt`, `cancelProcessingTx`, `splitBatchIntoIndividualTxs`, gas/simulation helpers including `simulateSafeAssetChanges` | Avoid letting content scripts inspect or alter local pending/history/status state. Nonce preview resolves only the account pinned to that pending request and does not reserve the nonce; replacement preparation accepts only a stored history ID/kind and reconstructs intent from the configured RPC; lazy detail reads operate only on a trusted stored row and configured RPC. Safe composite simulation is read-only and accepts only the reviewed calls plus exact public execution envelope from trusted wallet UI. |
| Residual-approval detection and cleanup | `detectResidualApprovals`, `addApprovalRevokeToTransactionBatch`, `appendApprovalRevokeToPendingBatch`, `appendApprovalRevokeToCrossDappBatch`, `appendApprovalRevokeToSafeProposal` | Prevent webpages from inspecting pending calls, rewriting requests, or manufacturing wallet-authored calls. Detection resolves only durable request IDs and uses the configured RPC under strict trace bounds. Mutation accepts only short-lived opaque evidence IDs, re-resolves the exact request fingerprint, constructs canonical `ERC20.approve(spender, 0)` calldata, and rechecks pinned source, wallet/chain capability, editability, duplicate/call limit, and storage claim. |
| Chat | `submitChatPrompt`, `getChatConversations`, `getChatConversation`, `createChatConversation`, `deleteChatConversation`, `addChatMessage`, `updateChatMessage` | Chat prompt submission uses the user's Bankr credentials/session and chat history is local user data. |
| Settings/cache | `setArcBrowser`, `getSidePanelMode`, `setSidePanelMode`, `getClearSigningEnabled`, `setClearSigningEnabled`, `INVALIDATE_CLEAR_SIGNING_CACHE` | These are extension UI preferences/cache controls, not dapp APIs. |
| Network settings | `ensureNetworksInfo`, `addNetwork`, `updateNetwork`, `setNetworkHidden`, `deleteNetwork`, `confirmAddChain` | Mutate provider-visible `networksInfo` / `chainName` and local saved-RPC history; keep service-worker-owned so webpages cannot alter RPC metadata or clobber user-added chains. |
| Safe discovery/import and request refresh | `probeSafeAddress`, `findSafesByOwner`, `importSafeAccount`, `getSafeAccounts`, `refreshSafeAccount`, `getSafeProposals`, `syncSafeRequests` | Safe authority snapshots and proposal records remain background-owned. Discovery/probing returns opaque, unguessable, 30-minute in-memory verification receipt IDs; import must bind those receipts to the exact address and requested chains. Review refresh accepts one current Safe account ID plus an optional previously imported chain ID and re-verifies the stored address directly through the configured RPC. Omitting the chain ID also checks only missing visible Safe-supported networks through the Transaction Service, but every hit requires exact onchain verification before merge and service failure cannot downgrade known snapshots. Expired, missing, mismatched, worker-lost, non-Safe account IDs, and unimported exact chain IDs fail closed. |

`getActiveAccount` is the narrow exception: `inject.ts` uses it during content
script initialization to correct stale synced address state before emitting
`accountsChanged`. Webpages cannot call it directly because `inject.ts` does
not forward an inpage message for it.

### Transaction History Enrichment Handlers

`getSendRecipientReferences` is a read-only `wallet-ui` route behind the exact
trusted top-level document gate. It returns at most 1,500 local contact/history
address references after scanning at most 10,000 history rows; errors are
explicit, not an empty successful check. No secrets, signing capabilities,
provider exposure, network call or independent storage key is introduced.
The additive IndexedDB `sendRecipient` field is derived from explicit Send
transaction contents before calldata compaction, not from renderer-supplied
recipient labels or token Transfer logs. Only successful hash-bearing records
contribute; pending/failed/impersonator/cancel/batch/protocol entries do not.
Consistent local transfer/native snapshots provide conservative legacy read
backfill. History clearing, retention, account-history deletion and reset
remove these references with their parent records.

The lookalike acknowledgement is deliberately a Send-screen UX gate, including
the sponsored fallback. It is not a new background signing authorization and
does not gate dapp/WC/Safe/batch confirmation routes. It resets when the entered
or resolved recipient, sender, chain or local reference generation changes.
Unknown/failed reads remain visibly unavailable and disable Send until retried.

| Handler | Effect | Guard |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `backfillAssetChanges` | Extension UI asks the service worker to re-fetch a confirmed tx receipt and populate missing `assetChanges` on an existing history entry. Does not expose secrets or create transactions. | `wallet-ui` audience policy |
| `getTransactionCalldata` | Loads a trusted stored transaction, fetches its hash from the configured RPC, and returns calldata only after exact hash/from/to validation. | `wallet-ui` audience policy |
| `resolveHistoryNftMetadata` | Resolves one trusted stored NFT contract/token ID at its receipt block (latest fallback). Raw token URI remains background-only; the renderer receives only bounded sanitized display fields. | `wallet-ui` audience policy |

### Authentication Handlers

| Handler               | Notes                                                                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `unlockWallet`        | Tries master password first, then agent. Sets `passwordType` accordingly |
| `setAgentPassword`    | Requires a master session and explicit master password, then proves the unwrapped general key recovers every current credential/local account before adding the agent wrapper. |
| `removeAgentPassword` | Requires explicit master password verification and the same full general-vault recovery proof before deleting the agent wrapper. |
| `canSetupPasskeyUnlock` | Preflights cached-master-session setup so agent/expired sessions fail before platform credential creation. The current Settings UI uses explicit-password step-up instead. |
| `setupPasskeyUnlock` / `setupPasskeyUnlockWithPassword` | Requires master authorization, validates local keys plus every seed derivation, then atomically stores the V2 mnemonic vault and purpose-separated passkey wrappers. |
| `unlockWithPasskey`   | V2 unwraps both general and mnemonic keys; V1 unwraps only the general key for backward-compatible signing. Transactionally hydrates a master session without caching/storing the master password. |
| `removePasskeyUnlock` | Requires explicit master-password verification, proves the general master wrapper recovers every current Bankr/private-key secret with correct account bindings, and validates complete V2 mnemonic recovery before clearing the local passkey wrapper. V1/no-mnemonic wallets retain compatible removal after the general proof. |
| `verifyMasterPassword` | Verifies an explicitly entered master password without hydrating or mutating the active session. Used for sensitive Settings step-up flows. |

All mutating unlock/lock/factor/password/reset handlers and persisted-session
restoration run through `authTransition.ts`. The queue makes cache/storage
commits linearizable across simultaneously open extension views, including
agent-password creation versus master-password rotation. WebAuthn
preflight/status responses also carry a random per-service-worker ceremony
epoch; lock, password change, reset, factor removal, successful unlock, and
worker suspension rotate it so an older native prompt cannot commit after a
newer security action or service-worker restart.

Manual lock additionally runs through `auth/sessionTermination.ts`, which holds
the wallet-secret operation lock before rotating the epoch and clearing cached
keys. This prevents an in-flight seed/private-key mutation from observing a
vault key that disappears halfway through its commit; operations queued behind
the lock retain their earlier epoch and fail closed.
The persisted split capability is revoked local-key-first and both storage
operations are attempted independently. Lock succeeds when either half is
confirmed gone and fails visibly when neither deletion can be confirmed.

For the same expiry boundary, `addKeyToVault` checks the persisted master
wrapper before selecting its encryption format. Once a wallet is migrated,
absence of the cached vault key is a lock condition—not permission to fall back
to password-encrypted legacy storage.

`chrome.runtime.sendMessage()` is extension-wide, so sibling trusted extension
pages may observe internal messages even though only the service worker handles
the passkey command. The security boundary is therefore all packaged extension
pages—not content scripts or webpages. No passkey-derived material may be logged,
persisted, or forwarded outside that boundary.

### Pending Transaction Edit Handlers

`updatePendingTxRequestData` mutates a pending single transaction's calldata
before the user signs, for example when the confirmation UI edits an ERC-20
approve amount. It must stay classified as `wallet-ui` so a webpage
cannot silently alter a pending tx between display and signing. Background-
authored replacement requests reject this mutation because only their gas may
change during review.

`getTransactionNonce` is the adjacent read-only review helper. It stays
`wallet-ui` only, accepts a pending transaction ID rather than an arbitrary
address, re-resolves the exact pinned PK/seed/Ledger account, verifies the
stored `from`, and previews the pending/cache nonce without advancing it. The
confirmation handlers accept an explicit nonce only as a non-negative safe
integer and only for native-gas PK/seed/Ledger execution; Bankr, impersonator,
force-inclusion, and fee-token paths cannot silently consume the override.

`prepareTransactionReplacement` is also `wallet-ui` only. It accepts no
renderer-authored transaction fields, account, nonce, or fee values. Under a
serialized preparation lock it re-resolves the stored history row and exact
account, rejects Bankr/impersonator and fee-token/force-inclusion rows, fetches
the transaction plus receipt and latest account nonce from the configured RPC,
and validates hash, signer, chain, pending block state, bounded calldata,
recipient, quantities, and supported transaction type. Only the oldest pending
nonce may be replaced. Type-3/type-4 transactions fail closed rather than
dropping blob or authorization-list semantics. The resulting request is pinned
as `trustedInternal`; confirmation requires the exact stored nonce, native gas,
and fee caps at or above the background-computed replacement floor. Replacement
content cannot be edited or added to a cross-dapp batch. Type-1 or non-empty
access-list transactions also fail closed because the released transaction
shape cannot reproduce those semantics. Cancel is authored as an empty
zero-value self-transfer, while Speed Up preserves the RPC transaction intent.
Its origin, favicon, and prior function label are copied only as public display
metadata; the signable `to`/value/data/nonce/fee fields still come exclusively
from the configured-RPC transaction and background fee policy.

Local and Ledger history records persist the nonce actually handed to the
signer. Receipt reconciliation may use a strictly greater configured-RPC
`latest` account nonce as proof that a missing transaction hash was displaced;
ambiguous broadcasts and derived force-inclusion hashes remain excluded from
this shortcut. A mined replacement receipt may walk only its exact stored
predecessor ID/hash chain and terminalize matching pending rows as `dropped`.

### Dapp-Initiated Batch Handlers (`batchTxHandlers.ts`)

`batchTxHandlers.ts` is an implementation-free compatibility facade.
The pure ERC-7821 byte encoding, call-value normalization, contract-creation
rejection, and payload-bearing EOA self-call rejection live in
`batch/batchTxEncoding.ts`. That module has no Chrome storage, session, network, API,
or signing dependency, and its output is frozen byte-for-byte in direct tests.
Both the Bankr and private-key/seed-phrase paths still consume the same exported
function identity through the established `batchTxHandlers.ts` import path.
Pending-call UI mutations, rejection, and origin-scoped `wallet_getCallsStatus`
and `wallet_showCallsStatus` reads live in `batchRequestStatusHandlers.ts`.
This keeps status disclosure and pending-request mutation separate from all key
resolution and signing paths while preserving the original facade identities.
`batchRequestIntake.ts` owns the shared injected/WalletConnect queue boundary:
it pins the validated account, chain, origin, tab/frame or WC request metadata;
commits a non-actionable `intakeStatus: "validating"` pending request before
its bundle status or any network-backed atomic-delegate probe; revalidates the
transport authorization around both writes; and compensates either partial
record before publishing a failed acknowledgement. The early row exists only
to paint the real review surface. Signing/edit/split/move controls are disabled,
while terminal rejection remains available and safely wins a race with intake.
The pending storage call-mutation helpers refuse the row, and both Bankr and local
confirmation handlers fail closed until the final authorization/durability
checks atomically remove the marker. It has no credential or signing access.

Capability discovery, PK/seed credential resolution, and execution are separate
audit boundaries. `batchCapabilities.ts` refuses addresses other than the exact
connected account before any delegate probe. `batchLocalConfirmation.ts`
consumes the pinned request and selects the single, atomic-7702, or sequential
path. `batchLocalAuthorization.ts` then re-resolves that exact account and
performs origin/WalletConnect authorization as the final await before beginning
the RPC effect. `batchSingleExecution.ts`, `batchSequentialExecution.ts`, and
`batchAtomic7702Execution.ts` own their distinct sign/broadcast state machines;
`batchCompletionTracking.ts` owns later aggregate status mirroring without
access to keys or credentials.

These mutate `pendingBatchTxRequests` (dapp `wallet_sendCalls`) before the user signs. All are classified as `wallet-ui` in `background/messageAccessPolicy.ts`:

| Handler                        | Effect                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `removeCallFromPendingBatch`   | Drops a single call from the pending bundle's `params.calls`. If the last call is removed, falls through to a full reject (writes `batchTxResult` + sets `bundleStatuses` to OFFCHAIN_FAILURE). The user is the only party who can prune calls — a dapp must not be able to silently shrink its own (or another dapp's) bundle. |
| `updateCallInPendingBatch`     | Replaces one call's `data` field in the pending bundle (e.g. user edits an ERC-20 approve amount on a built-in CallCard). Validates hex format only — the user is responsible for the resulting calldata being semantically valid; the downstream confirmation re-simulates and re-estimates from the new bytes. Must stay extension-only so a content script cannot silently mutate another bundle's calls (e.g. swap a benign approve amount for `MAX_UINT256`) between display and signing. |
| `appendApprovalRevokeToPendingBatch` | Appends background-authored canonical `approve(spender, 0)` calls after every dapp-authored call. The route accepts only opaque evidence IDs bound to the exact pending bundle fingerprint, permits only pinned PK/seed requests with an existing WalletChan EIP-7702 atomic path, rejects stale/validating/claimed/duplicate/over-limit rows under the request lock, preserves source routing, and marks the request atomic-required. |

### Cross-Dapp Batch Handlers (`crossDappBatchHandlers.ts`)

These move pending tx requests in/out of a user-assembled batch and ship the batch via Bankr API or PK/SP EIP-7702 local signing. All are classified as `wallet-ui` in `background/messageAccessPolicy.ts` so a malicious dapp cannot reach into the user's pending tx queue:

The root handler is export-only; implementations live under
`crossDappBatch/`. `storage.ts` preserves the non-secret released schema,
`intake.ts` persists staging before source removal, and `lifecycle.ts` removes
unauthorized source groups before terminal publication. Confirmation acquires
its duplicate-submit lock before asynchronous reads, validates the persisted
account/from/chain lock, and delegates to separate Bankr or PK/seed signers.
Both signer paths acquire a reset-aware effect lease and perform final live
account, origin/WalletConnect, and synchronous epoch-commit checks immediately
before the irreversible network effect. `completion.ts` keeps transaction
result keys separate from source ERC-5792 bundle statuses and preserves one
atomic result for every sibling group.

| Handler                       | Effect                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `addToCrossDappBatch`         | Removes a `pendingTxRequest` and appends it to `crossDappBatch`. Dapp promise stays open.        |
| `addApprovalRevokeToTransactionBatch` | Atomically stages a pinned PK/seed single transaction followed by evidence-bound canonical cleanup calls, then removes the source pending row. The generated entries inherit source authority but own no dapp result route. |
| `addCallsToCrossDappBatch`    | Removes a `pendingBatchTxRequest` (dapp `wallet_sendCalls`), appends every call as a sibling entry sharing one `bundleId`. The dapp's `bundleStatuses` entry stays at PENDING. |
| `appendApprovalRevokeToCrossDappBatch` | Appends evidence-bound canonical cleanup calls after validated staged sources. Generated entries are linked to their parent transaction/bundle, excluded from result fan-out, and removed with the parent. |
| `removeFromCrossDappBatch`    | For `eth_sendTransaction` entries: writes rejection to `txResult:{txId}`. For `wallet_sendCalls` entries: removes ALL siblings from the same bundle and updates `bundleStatuses` to OFFCHAIN_FAILURE once. Clears the batch if empty. |
| `updateCallInCrossDappBatch`  | Replaces one entry's `tx.data` in the cross-dapp batch (e.g. user edits an ERC-20 approve amount on a built-in CallCard). Validates hex only; the originating dapp's promise stays open until the batch ships, so the dapp never sees the edited bytes until on-chain confirmation. Must stay extension-only for the same reason as the dapp-initiated variant. |
| `rejectCrossDappBatch`        | Writes rejection to every entry — `txResult:{txId}` for plain entries, deduped `bundleStatuses` updates for bundle entries. Clears the batch. |
| `confirmCrossDappBatch`       | Encodes via ERC-7821, ships via Bankr API or EIP-7702 local signing. PK/SP EIP-7702 keeps native value in the inner calls but signs the outer EOA self-call with `value: 0x0`; Bankr keeps the summed outer value. Plain `eth_sendTransaction` entries receive the shared tx hash immediately; `wallet_sendCalls` bundle entries stay PENDING until the shared receipt is terminal, then transition to CONFIRMED/REVERTED once per bundle. Accepts UI-provided gas estimates and must stay extension-only so a content script cannot choose gas or fake source-bundle completion. |

`addToCrossDappBatch`, `addCallsToCrossDappBatch`, and `confirmCrossDappBatch` must resolve the original pinned account (`accountId` / `accountAddress` / `accountType`) directly. Never bind a pending request to the current active account, especially when `wallet_sendCalls.params.from` is omitted or the user switches accounts while the request is open.

**Why these MUST stay extension-only**: a content script that could call any of these would be able to (a) silently move a user's pending requests into a batch they cannot easily inspect, (b) reject other dapps' pending requests by spelling out the right `txId`s or `bundleId`s, or (c) flip a victim dapp's bundle status to CONFIRMED without an actual onchain transaction, tricking the dapp into believing a payment landed. The `txId`s and `bundleId`s are not secret, but the right to act on them belongs to the popup only.

`handleConfirmCrossDappBatch` follows the centralized **session restoration pattern** for `getCachedApiKey()` (see "Handlers with Session Restoration" in `_docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md`), so it works after a service-worker restart for an unexpired finite passkey session or an explicit Never session.

### WalletConnect Handlers

WalletConnect lets dapps that do not discover WalletChan through ERC-6963 send requests through the WalletConnect relay instead of the injected provider. The relay itself is untrusted: every tx/signature request still becomes a normal pending request and must pass the same pinned-account confirmation flow as injected dapp requests.

| Handler | Effect | Guard |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `walletConnectGetSessions` | Extension UI reads active WalletConnect session summaries. No secrets; includes dapp metadata, approved chains, and approved accounts. | `wallet-ui` audience policy |
| `walletConnectPair` | Extension UI pairs with a `wc:` URI. The service worker auto-approves only for the current active signing account and visible chains. | `wallet-ui` audience policy |
| `walletConnectDisconnectSession` | Extension UI disconnects an active WalletConnect session by topic. | `wallet-ui` audience policy |
| `walletConnectSwitchChain` | Extension UI updates the shared WalletConnect active chain and emits `chainChanged` to active WC sessions that support the chain. | `wallet-ui` audience policy |

WalletConnect implementation lives in the `chrome/walletConnect/` audit domain,
not in `background.ts`. `client.ts` owns only SDK lifecycle/listeners;
`sessionProposal.ts` approves namespaces only for an active signing account;
`requestRouter.ts` claims and validates relay requests before dispatch;
`pendingRequests.ts`, `batchRequests.ts`, and `rpcRequests.ts` adapt requests to
the existing wallet boundaries. Approved accounts derive from the active
account at pairing time and its visible chains; Bankr accounts expose only
Bankr-supported chains.

Chainless `eip155` proposal namespaces are filled with that same visible chain set before approval, because some dapps request EVM methods without listing chains. If normalization still leaves no approvable namespace, the proposal is rejected rather than approved with an empty namespace. The rejection broadcast (`walletConnectProposalRejected`) contains only bounded/sanitized dapp metadata, capped requested chain IDs/methods, and known public chain metadata used to render the chain notice and prefill Add Chain; it contains no secrets or session request payloads. Unsafe peer URL/icon schemes and overlong metadata are discarded before storage or UI rendering.

`walletConnect/keepalive.ts` runs only while approved WalletConnect sessions exist. It sends periodic `*_batchFetchMessages` requests to the WalletConnect relay so the MV3 service worker stays awake and can receive relay requests without an open popup/sidepanel. The keepalive uses session topics and relay routing metadata only; it does not read cached passwords, API keys, private keys, seed phrases, or transaction payload secrets.

`walletConnect/client.ts` constructs every WalletConnect Core with
`telemetryEnabled: false`. WalletConnect SDK diagnostic telemetry and its
persistent telemetry client identifier must not be enabled in the extension;
pairing, session relay, and active-session keepalive requests are functional
transport traffic rather than product analytics.

WalletConnect session methods are account-specific. Bankr, private-key, and
seed-phrase accounts retain the full supported EOA method set. Ledger sessions
allow single transactions plus `personal_sign` and validated EIP-712, but do
not advertise or accept ERC-5792 or delegated-permission methods. Verified
Safe sessions allow single transactions and ERC-5792 capability/batch/status
methods, while EOA-style signatures and delegated permissions remain excluded.
Impersonator accounts cannot approve a session. These proposal-time method
limits are repeated by request-time namespace and account-resolution checks.

For `eth_sendTransaction`, the WC request is converted to a `PendingTxRequest` with `accountId` / `accountAddress` / `accountType` pinned through `pinnedTxRequest()`. For `personal_sign` / typed-data signatures, the request is converted to a `PendingSignatureRequest` through `pinnedSignatureRequest()`. Confirm-time signing still routes through `txHandlers.ts`, so Bankr, private-key, and seed-phrase accounts keep their existing password/session-restoration behavior. View-only impersonator accounts cannot sign; their only send path is the separately reviewed per-RPC developer opt-in described under Network Metadata Handlers.

For ERC-5792 `wallet_sendCalls`, the WC request reuses `batchTxHandlers.ts` and is converted to a `PendingBatchTxRequest` with the account authorized in the WalletConnect session passed explicitly into the batch handler. The pending request and bundle status pin exact `{ topic, requestId, method }` transport metadata, and the bundle status is scoped to the WalletConnect peer metadata, so another WC peer cannot query, confirm, or open a bundle it did not create.

Batch acknowledgement is part of the authorization boundary. Injected intake
owns the batch's first-action claim before its first async permission read and
publishes a durable acknowledgement only after queue persistence. The injected
page waits without an age-based timer; WalletConnect awaits queue persistence
before reading the same acknowledgement. Queue persistence revalidates the
exact tab/origin or live WalletConnect topic before and after its storage
writes.

Security rules:

- `tx.from` and signature signer params must match the account authorized in the WalletConnect session.
- `wallet_sendCalls.params.from` and per-call `from` fields must match the account authorized in the WalletConnect session.
- `eth_sign` and deprecated `eth_signTypedData` v1 are rejected, matching the injected-provider path.
- `eth_signTypedData_v3` / `_v4` run the same EIP-712 validation and sanitization as injected requests, including raw ERC-7710 `Delegation` rejection.
- ERC-7715 requests (`wallet_getSupportedExecutionPermissions`, `wallet_getGrantedExecutionPermissions`, `wallet_requestExecutionPermissions`) route through the stable `erc7715PermissionHandlers.ts` facade. Method dispatch/intake, account-scoped queries, onchain status, revoke prompt creation, and master-only confirmation live together in the `chrome/erc7715/` audit domain. Permission requests preflight local-signer account type, request shape, permission/rule allowlists through the stable `erc7715/registry.ts` facade (`permissionTypes.ts` → `ruleValidation.ts` → `permissionValidation.ts`), relaxed EVM address validation plus checksum normalization from `erc7715/address.ts`, WalletChan-owned caveat derivation through the stable `erc7715/caveats.ts` facade (`caveatDefinitions.ts` → `caveatEncoding.ts` → `caveatBuilder.ts`), `from`/selected-account consistency, supported chain/RPC availability, and live EIP-7702 delegation to `EIP_7702_DEFAULT_DELEGATE`. Pure validation, normalization, and caveat encoding cannot import account/session/Chrome/RPC state; `preflightEligibility.ts` is the stateful orchestration boundary and `preflightRpc.ts` owns only bounded public-chain reads. Injected requests resolve the sender tab account with `getTabAccount(tabId)` before preflight/listing; WalletConnect requests resolve the session-authorized account. `erc7715/confirmation.ts` signs only WalletChan-constructed ERC-7710 typed data after user confirmation and requires a live master/password-or-biometric session; an agent session cannot issue the reusable capability even when the prompt was queued under master. The auth epoch and live master type are re-checked synchronously at one atomic local-storage commit that writes `erc7715PermissionGrants`, removes the pending prompt, and publishes its success result. That commit is the grant linearization point, preventing both post-commit false failures and duplicate approval retries.
- ERC-7715 caveat generation follows the deployed DeleGator v1.3.0 standard shapes: native-token grants include `ExactCalldataEnforcer(0x)`, ERC-20 grants include `ValueLteEnforcer(0)`, standard grants include `NonceEnforcer(currentNonce)`, allowance grants use the relevant periodic enforcer with `periodDuration = uint256.max`, and the EIP-712 `Caveat` type signs only `enforcer` and `terms` while ABI context/revoke encoding retains `args`. Dapps cannot supply arbitrary caveat enforcer addresses through ERC-7715.
- If the user edits a request in the confirmation UI, `lib/erc7715PermissionEditing.ts` keeps fixed identity fields immutable (chain, account, delegate, permission type, token, adjustment policy). `permission.isAdjustmentAllowed` gates amount, periodic frequency, start time, stream rate / initial allowance / max allowance edits; streams still require expiry and `maxAmount > initialAmount`. Non-stream expiry can be added, removed, extended, or shortened even when permission terms are locked, matching WalletChan's confirmation behavior. Token-approval-revocation method flags remain immutable and only the required expiry can be adjusted. Confirmation then re-runs ERC-7715 preflight and recomputes caveats from the edited request before signing.
- The registry rejects ambiguous extras, unbounded non-stream amounts, periodic durations over ten years, streams without expiry, stream max caps that do not exceed initial allowance, token approval revocation without an expiry, token approval revocation without at least one enabled method, broad `permit2InvalidateNonces` revocation, malformed token addresses, expired/duplicate expiry rules, invalid start times, start times after expiry, and oversized/ambiguous justification metadata. Missing non-revocation `startTime` values are normalized to the preflight timestamp. Permit2 revocation primitives additionally require a WalletChan built-in chain with live code at the canonical Permit2 address on the configured RPC. `permission.justification` is display-only and normalized out of `permission.data` before caveat derivation.
- While a `wallet_requestExecutionPermissions` request is active, the injected provider, background router, and WalletConnect router block additional external dapp transaction/signature/batch/RPC proxy/capabilities/status/watch/add-chain/execution-permission requests with the standard in-process error. The background/WC block is backed by every valid row in `pendingErc7715PermissionRequests`, not only process memory, so it survives MV3 service-worker restarts and fails closed until storage-backed lock state is loaded.
- The ERC-7715 enqueue path must synchronize `erc7715/requestLock.ts` from the saved pending-request list before releasing the in-memory request lock. Do not rely only on `chrome.storage.onChanged`; that event can arrive after the handler returns and briefly reopen external request processing.
- ERC-7715 approval/rejection/explicit-invalidation results are delivered through `erc7715PermissionResult:{id}` instead of long-lived `sendMessage` channels. Injected dapps create the request id in `inject.ts` and wait on that storage key without an age timer; WalletConnect stores kind `erc7715Permission` in `walletConnectPendingRequests`, commits the first terminal response before relay delivery, and replays only that result after relay/MV3 recovery.
- ERC-7715 grant management uses extension-only messages (`getErc7715PermissionGrantsForAccount`, `initiateErc7715PermissionRevoke`). They must not be forwarded from content scripts because grant records contain reusable signed delegation context. Active grant reads check `eth_getCode(account)`, `disabledDelegations(hash)`, and stored `NonceEnforcer` terms through the configured chain RPC, then locally mark grants revoked before returning them to Account Settings or dapps if the EOA is no longer delegated to WalletChan's default DeleGator, the delegation hash is disabled, or the nonce was invalidated. Any onchain status read failure fails closed. Onchain revoke validates account/grant ownership, canonical DelegationManager consistency, and the stored delegator before checking onchain status and queueing `disableDelegation(delegation)` through the normal transaction confirmation path; the pending tx carries only public display metadata plus `grantId`, while the reusable delegation context stays in the extension-only grant store. The receipt poller marks the grant locally revoked only after a successful receipt.
- WalletConnect ERC-7715 grants are scoped by session topic (`walletconnect:<topic>`), not self-reported peer URL. Peer URL/name/icon metadata is display-only and may be untrusted.
- Only a small allowlist of read-only RPC methods is proxied to the user's configured RPC URL. Raw transaction submission and debugging methods are not proxied, and privileged RPC fetches use `redirect: "error"` so an allowed endpoint cannot redirect onto private/loopback infrastructure.
- `walletConnectPendingRequests` contains only public request routing/JSON-RPC response metadata, never wallet secrets. Each remote `(topic, requestId)` is atomically claimed before any queue entry is created, preventing relay replays from signing/broadcasting twice. A terminal `txResult:{id}`, `sigResult:{id}`, `erc7715PermissionResult:{id}`, or immediate `wallet_sendCalls` bundle id is persisted before relay delivery; the route is cleared only after delivery succeeds or WalletKit confirms session termination. Manual disconnect gates and terminalizes the session's pending approvals before SDK disconnect, but retains any undelivered outbox entry until disconnect succeeds; remote `session_delete` performs the same cleanup at the confirmed termination boundary.
- `walletConnectChainId` contains only non-secret UI/session state. It is scoped to WalletConnect and does not overwrite injected-provider per-tab chain state.

### EIP-7702 Delegation Handlers (`delegation/`)

These are UI-only Smart Account management messages classified as `wallet-ui`:

| Handler | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `getDelegationStatus` / `probeDelegateContract` | Reads onchain delegation and probes ERC-7821 support. Kept extension-only to avoid leaking account delegation state and custom-chain probing to webpages. |
| `initiateSetDelegation` / `initiateRevokeDelegation` | Enqueues a type-4 pending tx request that the user confirms through the normal transaction confirmation flow. Must stay extension-only so a webpage cannot queue smart-account Set/Revoke prompts. A custom/non-default Set requires a live master session both when queued and immediately before raw broadcast; canonical-default authorization remains routine agent-capable signing, and revocation remains agent-capable because it reduces authority. |

`delegationHandlers.ts`, `delegationStorage.ts`, and
`delegatedAuthorityPolicy.ts` are effect-free compatibility facades. The
implementation is split into status/probe, Set/Revoke intake, pure request
construction, durable queueing, authority policy, and storage modules so each
boundary can be audited independently. Custom Set requests capture the exact
master auth epoch before their ERC-7821 re-probe; queue persistence rechecks it
inside the wallet-secret operation lock and stores it on the pending request
before any UI notification. Canonical-default Set and revocation deliberately
omit that epoch because they are routine/reducing authority operations.

`setCustomDelegate` / `removeCustomDelegate` are `delegation/storage.ts`
helpers used
only by receipt reconciliation. They are deliberately not runtime message
routes: `customDelegates` is a UI mirror, and extension pages do not need a
general-purpose way to overwrite it.

Set/Revoke storage reconciliation must read `eth_getCode(EOA)` after any terminal receipt. Do not infer delegation state only from `receipt.status`: EIP-7702 authorization processing occurs before normal execution, so execution can revert while the EOA delegation still changed. If the `eth_getCode` read itself fails, leave the mirror unchanged; an RPC failure is not evidence that the EOA is undelegated.

### ERC-20 fee payment (`feePayment/`)

Token fee payment is an extension-only confirmation capability, never a new
provider signing method. `getFeePaymentOptions` and `prepareFeePaymentQuote`
are wallet-UI messages. Normal transaction/batch/Safe execution claims remain
their sole terminal decisions; cross-dapp confirmation uses its existing
active-batch claim, and the in-wallet Swap route uses the same one-shot
quote boundary under a reset-aware internal-operation claim. Quotes live only in service-worker memory
for 45 seconds and bind request family/id, exact calls, account identity,
chain, EntryPoint nonce, delegation state, paymaster, and bounded maximum. Safe
quotes bind the proposal ID, selected private-key/seed executor, proposal chain,
and exact outer `execTransaction` call. Switching executors clears the renderer
quote, and the background independently resolves the submitted executor ID.
They are consumed once before pending request removal; a missing/restarted
worker, edited call, account switch, nonce race, allowance change, or delegate
change leaves the review retryable and requires a fresh quote.

The `crossDappBatch` quote family resolves the active durable batch in the
background and binds its creation-derived request ID, pinned account/address,
chain, and exact ordered calls. The renderer cannot provide replacement calls.
Before broadcast, every distinct injected/WalletConnect source authority is
revalidated and synchronously committed. Restart recovery persists only
bounded public transaction IDs and ERC-5792 bundle IDs beside the deterministic
UserOperation hash; wallet-generated cleanup entries are excluded. The real
transaction hash is released to source dapps only after the matching onchain
EntryPoint event is independently verified.

Internal Swap quote input is accepted only from the trusted wallet UI and is
bounded to 50 calls, positive safe-integer chain IDs, exact 20-byte destinations,
even-length calldata, and hex quantities. The quote family is `internalSwap`,
separate from provider request families. Execution re-resolves the pinned
account ID/address, requires every reviewed transaction to retain that `from`
and chain, and consumes a matching request ID/account/call fingerprint before
any credential is used. PK/seed and already-delegated Bankr accounts reuse the
atomic fee-payment batch signer; Ledger, impersonator, and Safe accounts cannot
enter this internal Swap token-payment path.

New transaction history retains only the public fee-token contract and settled
base-unit charge. Symbol, decimals, logo, price, quote maximum, and paymaster are
not duplicated per row. The paymaster used for receipt classification comes
from the exact verified onchain `UserOperationEvent`; the fee token and exact
charge come from that paymaster's matching `UserOperationSponsored` event.
Classification removes only a matching treasury debit or charge/refund pair.
If that match cannot be proven, the transfer remains visible and no fee amount
is invented. The bundler's native outer cost is never treated as an account debit.

The confirmation renderer bounds option discovery to 10 seconds and quote
preparation to 30 seconds. Timeout invalidates late callbacks and enters an
explicit-retry error state; it never creates an automatic retry loop or silently
falls back to native payment. Quote expiry invalidates Confirm and requires an
explicit Retry instead of starting a background refresh. Switching to native
invalidates the pending renderer request. Background proxy calls retain their
own transport deadlines. The confirmation parent is the sole owner of a
completed quote. The selector never clears that quote on mount/rerender, and a
per-request attempt guard stays set before loading begins, so callback ordering
cannot expose a false idle state that re-enters `prepareFeePaymentQuote`.

Fresh local accounts use Pimlico's documented dummy 7702 authorization plus
an exact sender-only code state override during estimation. The proxy accepts
that override only for `eth_estimateUserOperationGas`, only when `eip7702Auth`
is present, and only when its sole field is WalletChan's immutable
`0xef0100 || officialDelegate` designator; submission never accepts an override.
The real authorization is created after final Confirm,
targets only `EIP_7702_DEFAULT_DELEGATE`, uses the current EOA nonce, and is
submitted only inside the exact signed UserOperation. A different/unknown
onchain delegate fails closed. Bankr may sign the exact UserOperation through
its recovered-signer-verified typed-data endpoint only when the official
delegate is already active; it cannot perform first-use authorization.

The submitted approval is absent when current allowance covers the maximum or
is exactly `approve(quotedPaymaster, maximumTokenCost)` inside the atomic
operation. `uint256.max` exists only in an unsigned estimation envelope. Final
envelope construction uses paymaster stub data for the last gas estimation,
then requests and applies signed paymaster data as the terminal mutation before
the account signature. If the final response omits its optional paymaster gas
limits, the previously estimated limits are retained; they must never be
zeroed merely because the optional fields are absent. Estimating or replacing gas fields after that point
would invalidate Pimlico's paymaster authorization and is forbidden. Final
pre-sign checks re-read account, request authority, EntryPoint/EOA nonce,
delegate, allowance, and selected-token balance. Each catalog token has an
absolute base-unit safety ceiling (100 units for stablecoins; one unit for the
currently enabled non-stable assets), and
force inclusion cannot combine with token payment. There is no native fallback
after token selection.

The public website proxy owns the Pimlico key. It is policy-constrained; read
and simulation calls are rate-limited public operations, while submission is
authenticated by the recovered sender signature. It method/chain/token/EntryPoint
allowlists every envelope, bounds request/response/time/rate, pins every exact
chain/token address pair from the reviewed catalog, and cryptographically verifies the exact WalletChan sender
signature before forwarding `eth_sendUserOperation`. Any attached 7702 tuple
must target the official delegate on the route chain with fixed-width `r/s`
and valid parity, and its signer must recover to the UserOperation sender.
Immediately before broadcast, WalletChan persists only the locally computed
EntryPoint v0.7 operation hash and public recovery routing. A definite provider
rejection removes the record; a transport/5xx/malformed or hash-mismatched
response remains outcome-unknown and is never blindly retried. Finality
requires an independently fetched chain receipt containing the matching
EntryPoint `UserOperationEvent` for the exact hash and sender; a bundler receipt
alone cannot terminalize Activity, a Safe provider result, or ERC-5792 status.
For Safe execution, the UserOperation hash is durable duplicate-submit evidence
but is never returned as the dapp's transaction hash; only the independently
verified outer onchain hash is released. Calldata, signatures,
authorizations, quotes, paymaster data, and credentials are never written to
`pendingUserOperations`.

The `customDelegates` mirror keeps its released nested record shape. All
read-modify-write mutations are linearized under `local:customDelegates` so
concurrent receipt reconciliation or account cleanup cannot drop another
account/chain update. Runtime execution still trusts onchain code and the
default-delegate registry, never this UI mirror.

### Token Metadata Handlers

`resolveTokenMetadata` and `lookupCustomToken` are gated by
the `wallet-ui` audience because they can include user-added custom-token
metadata from `customTokens`. `addCustomToken`, `updateCustomToken`, and
`removeCustomToken` are also extension-only so webpages cannot mutate the user's
manual token list. Content scripts may still call the narrower `fetchTokenInfo`
/ `fetchTokenLogo` helpers; those return public chain/token-list metadata only
and do not expose watched-asset custom-token records.

The stable root token modules are export-only facades over `chrome/tokens/`.
`customTokenStorage.ts` is the sole owner of the unchanged `customTokens` array
and its serialized read-modify-write lock. `tokenMetadata.ts` keeps custom-token
lookup opt-out explicit so the public logo route cannot expose watched-asset
metadata. NFT URI parsing and image-source sanitization are pure in
`nftMetadataPolicy.ts`; only `nftMetadata.ts` may fetch, and it revalidates each
manual redirect against the public-HTTPS policy, omits credentials/referrers,
times out after five seconds, and streams at most 256 KiB. SVG/HTML never
becomes a renderer image source. Calldata discovery is capped at 64 unique
ABI-padded addresses; failed Multicall3 preflight returns only that already
bounded list and never expands authority or performs a transaction.

### Network Metadata Handlers

`networksInfo` mutations are routed through the service-worker-owned network
domain and classified as `wallet-ui`. Settings changes use
`network/networkMutations.ts`; confirmed EIP-3085 changes use
`network/dappNetworkApproval.ts`. Popup/sidepanel pages mirror
`chrome.storage.sync.networksInfo` through `NetworksContext`; they must not
write full local snapshots back to storage. This prevents a stale long-lived
sidepanel from deleting a chain that was added by a dapp confirmation in the
background.

Each entry's required `rpcUrl` remains the only endpoint used at runtime.
`chrome.storage.local.networkRpcUrls` is separate Settings-only history keyed
by decimal chain ID. The service worker validates every member with the same
scheme, credential, private-network, length, and trusted-origin rules,
deduplicates the list, rejects more than ten endpoints, and limits optional
display names to 64 characters before storage. An optional exact-boolean
`allowImpersonatedTransactions` flag grants only the selected endpoint the
ability to receive reviewed view-only transactions through
`eth_sendTransaction`; malformed/truthy non-booleans decode disabled. Released string-array records
remain read-compatible and are converted to `{ url, name? }` objects only on a
later successful save. Provider favicon lookup is derived only for public
domain RPCs; private, loopback, literal-IP, and reserved hostnames are never
sent to the external favicon service, and returned bytes cross the existing
background rasterization/cache boundary before renderer display.
Selecting a saved endpoint does not bypass chain-ID probing. Built-in-chain
selection/add/edit/remove actions promote the chosen endpoint immediately only
after the renderer probe and existing service-worker `updateNetwork` validation
succeed; the explicit warning override still uses that same route. Editing an
inactive saved endpoint changes history only. Custom-chain endpoint changes stay
staged until the full form is saved. A custom chain-ID change is duplicate-checked
and re-keys its bounded RPC history inside the same locked service-worker
mutation. Missing history resolves to the active endpoint and requires no eager
migration.

An add-chain request for an already-visible chain remains a content-bridge
no-op success. A matching hidden chain must enter the durable confirmation flow.
On approval, `dappNetworkApproval.ts` revalidates the endpoint against the
request origin, re-resolves the chain ID under `sync:networksInfo`, preserves
WalletChan-owned identity/capability metadata, moves the previous active RPC
into bounded local history, promotes the approved RPC, and clears `hidden`.
Existing-chain promotion is pinned to the original pending request chain ID,
so editing or forging the confirmation payload cannot replace another known
chain's RPC. Rejection performs no network or RPC-history mutation. Bankr may
unhide the chain but cannot switch to a chain outside its supported allowlist.

The impersonated-transaction path remains a trusted-UI confirmation route and
never signs. Send and built-in Swap may stage the same review UI for a
view-only account. Single requests remain reject-only and Swap confirmation
remains disabled unless the exact selected endpoint is opted in. Before an
irreversible RPC call, the background revalidates the pinned account
ID/address/type, current chain RPC, and exact selected endpoint flag under the
network mutation lock; dapp and WalletConnect requests additionally revalidate
their request authorization. Built-in multi-leg swaps submit reviewed legs
sequentially and stop the unsent tail after any definite or ambiguous failure.
The flag does not authorize provider-specific admin methods, signature
requests, ERC-5792/cross-dapp batches, fee-token gas, or delegated authority.
RPCs must be configured separately to unlock/impersonate the `from` address. A
missing RPC response is treated as ambiguous and prevents later swap legs from
being sent.
The same exact selected-endpoint opt-in permits connected sites and
WalletConnect peers to use the existing bounded read-only RPC allowlist against
that configured private endpoint, so transaction preflight such as
`eth_estimateGas` works on a local fork. It does not admit another URL or enable
submission, signing, debug/admin, or stateful filter methods through the proxy.

### Privileged Network and Remote-Image Boundaries

The extension has broad HTTP(S) host access, so background fetches must not
turn that privilege into a private-network proxy or an unbounded memory sink.

`dapp/reputationClient.ts` posts one hostname derived from durable
Chrome-attested pending state to the fixed WalletChan API URL. The shared
bounded reader rejects redirects and ambient credentials/referrers and applies
a 4-second deadline and 16 KiB response ceiling. The response is schema checked
before combination, including exact outcome/match-type pairing for custom
trusted results. MetaMask blocklist and fuzzy outcomes take priority over the
custom allowlist and DefiLlama recognition. Reputation failure is display-only
and fail-open with an explicit unavailable warning; a positive result likewise
grants no permission and cannot reach signing or submission.

`network/safeRpcForwarding.ts` applies the following boundary to injected-provider and
WalletConnect RPC forwarding:

- Only the explicit public read/simulation method allowlist is accepted; raw
  transaction submission, signing, debug/admin, and stateful filter lifecycle
  methods are rejected.
- Injected requests must name an exact RPC URL already present in
  service-worker-owned `networksInfo`. WalletConnect resolves the same trusted
  chain configuration before calling the shared forwarding primitive.
- URLs must be HTTP(S), must not contain URL credentials, and are classified
  with `privateNetworkPolicy.ts`. Public sites cannot name literal/reserved
  loopback or private targets. Loopback dapps may reach loopback RPCs; a LAN
  dapp may reach only another port on its exact hostname, not a different
  private host. Literal IPv4, IPv6,
  IPv4-mapped IPv6 (including WHATWG's canonical two-hextet form), localhost,
  link-local, private, carrier-grade NAT, IPv4 documentation/benchmark,
  multicast, and reserved local hostname suffixes are covered by the
  classifier. The only remote-site exception is an exact active private RPC
  carrying the trusted Settings-only impersonated-transaction opt-in; it still
  receives only the read/simulation allowlist above.
- Redirects are rejected. Requests are capped at 524,288 serialized
  characters, responses are streamed under an 8,000,000-byte ceiling, at most
  16 forwarded calls run concurrently, and each call has a 15-second timeout.
  Remote JSON-RPC error text is capped before it reaches the UI.

All other configured-RPC paths use `network/rpcClient.ts`. Its direct JSON-RPC
primitive consumes responses under a deadline and byte ceiling, rejects
redirects, omits cookies/referrers, bounds error text, and caps concurrency.
The shared viem transport also uses a private bounded fetch adapter: it pins
the validated endpoint against request-hook retargeting, accepts POST only,
caps serialized requests at 1 MB, streams responses under 8 MB, shares a
24-request concurrency ceiling, and enforces a 15-second default / 60-second
hard-maximum deadline in addition to the redirect and ambient-credential
policy. This covers simulation, balance, name-resolution, delegation, gas,
nonce, receipt, and local-signing clients. New public RPC configuration must
use HTTPS; explicit local/private Settings RPCs may use HTTP. A dapp-proposed
add-chain URL is checked against the trusted sender origin before persistence,
again before confirmation, and before the privileged chain-ID probe.

The diagnostic Shield readiness route uses that same bounded viem transport to
send 14 fixed reads in JSON-RPC batches of at most three requests to a
user-configured active-chain RPC, or WalletChan's immutable known-chain default.
It is not invoked by the normal Shield UI. The
request contains only `eth_chainId`, five fixed-address `eth_getCode` reads,
the fixed Entrypoint EIP-1967 implementation slot, and fixed public pool/
Entrypoint getters. It contains no WalletChan account, phrase, commitment,
label, amount, recipient, or transaction. The RPC can observe the user's IP and
request timing. WalletChan locally compares every response with the immutable
compile-time-selected manifest; a transport/decode mismatch is a generic failure, never a
fallback or success. The response remains in the service worker. Durable
operation preparation independently runs the same deployment verification
before it can persist or queue a deposit.

After the user enters the desired net Shielded ETH amount, the wallet-UI-only
quote route uses the
selected active-chain RPC for public balance and fee reads plus
`eth_estimateGas` against the pinned Entrypoint native `deposit(uint256)` call.
The RPC receives the selected public address, grossed-up candidate amount,
exact calldata,
and a random throwaway public precommitment, and can correlate those with IP
and timing. That precommitment is never returned, stored, or accepted by a
later preparation path. The handler resolves the submitted account ID,
address, and type against storage; Bankr/private-key/seed-phrase/Ledger addresses may
quote and impersonators fail before RPC. The response is exact decimal strings
for balance, minimum, gross deposit, protocol fee, exact Shield credit, gas
reserve, total, net Max, and affordability. Max selects and re-simulates the
exact post-gas gross balance when fee-floor rounding gives one net amount two
adjacent gross values. Internal RPC errors collapse to one
bounded message. There is no secret access, signing, durable operation, or
mutation dependency.

The separate `privacyPrepareShieldReview` route performs no additional RPC
effect beyond obtaining a fresh quote. It requires a live password or fresh
biometric master session before quoting, then rechecks the auth epoch and exact
stored account under the wallet-secret lock. The dedicated privacy key
decrypts the phrase only in the service worker; neither phrase, derived
nullifier/secret, precommitment, nor calldata is returned. The router projects
only the public chain/account/gross/fee/net/Entrypoint tuple and ready status.
The exact-shape wallet-UI request carries the accepted public gross quote; the
background proves that its fee-deducted value equals the entered net amount and
simulates that exact gross value before using it.

`privacyPrepareShield` performs one fresh deployment verification and quote,
then rechecks the master epoch and exact account under the wallet-secret lock.
Its exact-shape request carries the same public gross quote pin, which is
revalidated against the entered net amount and included in the durable
account/amount correlation key. That non-unique key is authenticated summary
metadata, never operation identity. Only the request UUID is idempotent, so an
exact UUID retry resumes its pinned operation while every fresh UUID atomically
reserves a new index even if an equal deposit is still in flight.
The real durable index is distinct from the review-only reserved index. Its
precommitment and exact calldata are encrypted with the dedicated privacy key
before the IndexedDB operation row and next-index counter commit atomically.
Only a bounded public summary returns through the wallet-UI route;
`privacyListShieldOperations` returns at most the newest 20 such summaries.
Neither route imports a signer, opens wallet confirmation, or performs an
onchain mutation.

The same exact trusted-UI list route may return at most 193 decrypted private
portfolio points only after the service worker verifies the cached privacy key
against the current vault record. IndexedDB stores their balance, price, and
USD value encrypted; malformed/tampered snapshots are ignored. When that key
is cold, the route may still aggregate confirmed and ASP-pending amounts from
the bounded public Shield operation summaries it returns in the same response.
It keeps private-ready, recoverable, and spendable balances at zero and releases
no commitment lineage or encrypted portfolio point. Public mode does not
request or combine these values with any public account portfolio.

Private Unshield is owned by the wallet-wide Privacy Pools identity, not the
currently selected public account. The prepare request accepts only request ID,
amount, and recipient; the execute request accepts only the durable operation
ID. Extra account fields fail exact-shape validation. Both stages require the
live dedicated privacy/master capability and revalidate encrypted commitment
lineage, so changing between Bankr, private-key, seed-phrase, or impersonator
display accounts cannot redirect the withdrawal or select different notes.
Agent sessions remain blocked. This is distinct from Shield deposits and
public ragequit, which still need an explicit transaction signer and remain
account-pinned through broadcast.

Receiver-paid Unshield is the explicit signer-bound exception. Its exact
wallet-UI request includes the receiving account snapshot and requires that
snapshot to resolve to a Bankr, private-key, seed-phrase, or Ledger account
whose address is exactly the recipient. Impersonators fail request validation. The
background proves with that recipient as `processooor`, validates all eight
public signals, simulates the exact encrypted calldata from the same address,
and checks its native gas balance before creating a trusted pending request.
The standard pinned-account signer path repeats account, calldata, roots,
deployment, and master-epoch authorization before its irreversible boundary.
Queue failure releases the commitment claim; rejection and pre-broadcast
failure become recoverable and release it immediately when unlocked or during
startup reconciliation.

`network/boundedHttp.ts` is the secure-default boundary for fixed WalletChan,
Bankr, swap/bridge, portfolio, CoinGecko, labels, clear-signing, and ABI lookup
HTTP calls. It rejects redirects, cookies, and referrers and enforces one
deadline plus a caller-sized streaming byte cap. Signed sponsored-transfer
authorizations and Bankr API keys therefore cannot follow a backend redirect
to another origin.

Portfolio egress has a 4 MiB byte ceiling plus a runtime codec that bounds raw
candidate counts, accepted tokens/positions/assets, string and URL lengths,
chain IDs, decimals, balances, and USD values before state or storage release.
The website also caps its public response to 1,000 value-ranked tokens. Omitted
value/count metadata preserves aggregate totals without retaining unbounded
dust-token objects in the extension.

Swap egress is isolated under `chrome/swap/`. `transport.ts` alone performs
fixed-proxy HTTP reads and retains the 2 MiB quote/catalog / 64 KiB price
ceilings plus bounded remote error text. Token catalogs pass a strict
2,000-entry codec before storage or caller release. `rpcClient.ts` alone resolves a
configured chain RPC through the shared bounded transport. ERC-20 and Permit2
read failures return zero as released UI fallback behavior; they cannot sign or
broadcast. `erc20.ts` and `permit2.ts` contain the only approval calldata
builders, with Permit2 amount clamped to `uint160` and expiry fixed to 30 days.
Token metadata/list/logo caches are non-secret, chain-and-address keyed, and
best-effort on write. The root `swapApi.ts` is an export-only facade, enforced
by architecture and behavior tests under `tests/swap/`.

Transaction simulation caps access-list asset candidates and enriched asset
changes at 128 and NFT change enrichment at 64. Approval projection caps
owner/token/spender pairs at 64 and recognized nested decoding at 128 calls
across four levels. It accepts only exact ERC-20/Permit2 event topics from
successful simulated calls, binds the event owner to the reviewed account and
Permit2 events to the canonical emitter, then requires block-pinned pre/final
allowance reads before claiming verification. Same-batch consumption,
revocation, reduction, expiry, and exact outer Safe reverts remove the row;
missing RPC/readback or unavailable Safe-envelope proof can produce only an
explicitly unverified warning. This path uses configured bounded RPC transport,
never debug tracing, retry state overrides, signing, submission, or storage.
Residual-approval projection runs later through the trusted wallet-UI route so
the primary asset preview never waits on it. At one pinned block it starts the
ordinary successful-transfer simulation alongside an optional configured-RPC
`debug_traceCall` whose isolated simulator wrapper preserves the reviewed
wallet/Safe as `msg.sender`. The bounded parser accepts only successful
positive `transferFrom(owner, ..., amount)` CALL frames and derives the exact
token and immediate EVM caller. When tracing is unsupported, transiently
unavailable, malformed, or incomplete, successful Approval events and each
successful request call's own target remain bounded fallback candidates.
Incoming, zero-value, NFT-shaped, failed, malformed, and truncated evidence
cannot produce an actionable warning.

One state-overridden simulator call then captures explicit-success allowance
reads for every candidate before the request, executes the exact ordered calls,
and captures every final read. Any reviewed-call failure, read failure, stale
request fingerprint, or zero final allowance suppresses the actionable row.
The trace transport uses the configured RPC directly under the shared URL
policy, a five-second deadline, two-MiB response ceiling, 512-frame/32-depth
parser bounds, per-endpoint single-flight, and short support/transient caches;
failure is silent and never retries in a loop. Detection stores only
short-lived in-memory opaque evidence IDs. Cleanup re-resolves the exact
durable request and fingerprint before constructing canonical
`approve(spender, 0)` calls, so the renderer cannot author token/spender
authority.
Portfolio-price projections cache only the derived price map with per-account
single-flight reads, so a confirmation cannot repeatedly hydrate or scan
complete holdings rows.

Bankr remote authority is isolated under `chrome/bankr/`: `response.ts` is
pure bounded validation, `transport.ts` owns only fixed-origin bounded HTTP,
`signing.ts` locally recovers the exact personal/EIP-712 signer,
`submission.ts` owns the irreversible-start and ambiguous-outcome boundary,
and `jobs.ts` owns bounded polling. `credentialBinding.ts` hashes only
authenticated ciphertext metadata, while `pendingAuthorization.ts` performs
the final pinned account/transport/tag gate. The `chat/` subdomain keeps the
unchanged `chatHistory` repository separate from prompt egress and session
orchestration.

Remote navigation metadata is separate from image/network fetch policy.
`externalNavigation.ts` accepts public HTTPS only; Settings-owned custom
explorers may retain explicit loopback HTTP(S) for local development while
dapp proposals cannot. It rejects URL credentials,
private/LAN targets, unsafe schemes, and reserved test/onion suffixes. The
portfolio API normalizes DeFi `siteUrl` values before caching, the row repeats
the check for legacy cache entries, unsafe legacy explorer values are dropped
during chain normalization, stored notification links are revalidated when
clicked, and remotely returned chat URLs become links only after the same
public-HTTPS check. External `_blank` anchors/windows explicitly use
`noopener,noreferrer`.

Extension pages self-host Outfit, JetBrains Mono, and Anton through bundled
`@fontsource` assets. They must not add remote font stylesheets, preconnects,
or CSS imports: those disclose extension-page opens and violate the no-remote-
code/store-review boundary.

The exact `browse.html` launcher may store the non-secret
`walletchan:browseBookmarkReminderDismissed:v1` DOM-localStorage flag. It is a
presentation preference only, contains no origin/account data, and grants no
capability. The bookmark reminder does not require the Chrome bookmarks
permission.

ENS/avatar/token-logo URLs are attacker-controlled display metadata.
The local-gateway ENS banner treats the mounted page the same way: its metadata
scraper forwards only a title and `http(s)` or `data:image/*` favicon URL, its
address field accepts only `.eth`, `.wei`, `.gwei`, or a raw 20-byte contract address,
and hosted-gateway navigation goes through the authorized
`ens-open-on-gateway` service-worker route. The manifest-facing
`ensBanner.ts` is initialization-only; parsing, transport, bookmark/gateway
actions, and closed-shadow rendering remain separate audit modules under
`ensBrowsing/banner/`. The banner does not fetch or evaluate page content.
The browser launcher never assigns raw local-gateway SVG favicon metadata to
the renderer. For resolver-backed favorites it first accepts only Chrome's
same-extension `/_favicon/` URL at fixed size 64 for an exact
HTTP IPFS/IPNS subdomain-gateway page, `https://*.eth.limo`,
`https://*.eth.link`, `https://*.wei.limo`, `https://*.wei.domains`, `https://*.gwei.domains`, or `https://*.w3eth.io` page;
apexes, non-gateway host shapes, credentials, unsafe ports, and hosted-gateway
lookalikes remain rejected. Custom Kubo hosts and ports are supported because
the display projection constructs this URL only after matching the actual page
against the normalized user setting. Chrome owns the processed icon bytes
already displayed in the tab; WalletChan neither fetches that local page nor
receives its SVG/document source.
Otherwise WalletChan projects only the captured
asset path onto the known public eth.limo, gwei.domains, or w3eth.io origin,
after which the normal public-HTTPS validation and raster decode/re-encode
boundary still applies.

Friendly local-gateway origin labels are also display-only. The renderer maps
an opaque CID/IPNS hostname back to retained `ensResolveCache` metadata only
when the URL is HTTP and its subdomain suffix and effective port exactly match
the user's normalized `ensBrowsing.gatewayHost` and `gatewayPort`. Hosted URLs,
lookalike suffixes, different ports, and unmatched labels remain unchanged.
Expired navigation records may supply a label, but never a route. The raw
browser-attested origin remains authoritative for permissions, provider
authorization, SIWE validation, transaction history, revocation, and opening a
tab, preventing the friendly label from becoming an origin-spoofing boundary.
The associated favicon follows the same display-only match. Unsafe inline SVG
metadata is skipped; renderer components accept only a previously sanitized
raster, a public HTTPS image that crosses the decode/re-encode cache, or
Chrome's same-extension fixed-size processed favicon URL.

ENS contenthash provenance is likewise display-only. Only trusted wallet UI
can call `getEnsContenthashLastUpdated`; content scripts and web-accessible ENS
pages fail the exhaustive background audience gate. The handler accepts one
bounded `.eth` name, sends GraphQL only to the fixed ENS subgraph endpoint with
credentials omitted, applies an 8-second/128-KiB response boundary, and reads
the returned public block through the bounded Ethereum RPC client. It returns
only a public millisecond timestamp or null, does not read account/session
state, and cannot authorize, delay, or mutate a connection request. Diagnostic
logs include only the bounded ENS name, public block number/timestamp, transport
mode, and sanitized failure stage; they never include the Graph API key,
resolver ID, or contenthash value.

`remoteImagePolicy.ts` and the `avatar/` audit domain behind the stable
`avatarImageCache.ts` facade therefore require public HTTPS on the default TLS
port with no URL credentials, reject reserved/private hosts through the same
IPv4/IPv6 classifier, and reject `.test`, `.invalid`, and `.onion`. Up to three
redirects are followed manually and every target is revalidated; fetches omit
credentials and referrers. Explicit raster MIME types are accepted. A generic
`application/octet-stream` declaration is accepted only when the bounded body
starts with a known JPEG, PNG, GIF, or WebP signature; SVG and other rich
document formats never cross the decoder boundary. The response
is streamed under a 2 MiB download ceiling, decoded to pixels, resized to at
most 128×128, re-encoded to WebP under 512 KiB, and only that inert data URL is
cached/rendered. At most two image fetches run concurrently in FIFO order and
same-URL work is single-flight. The renderer sanitizer separately accepts only
policy-compliant remote URLs or bounded base64 raster data URLs, never SVG data
URLs. Raw remote URLs remain inert in trusted renderers until those
background-reencoded bytes arrive. The reset-aware Chrome cache is the sole
image source: legacy DOM localStorage image/portfolio mirrors are purge-only,
persisted entries are revalidated, commits are locked and best-effort, and
reset/fresh onboarding abort plus epoch-invalidate old-wallet work. A storage
write that crosses the reset epoch removes its stale entry before returning.
NFT tokenURI metadata uses the same public-host/redirect rules, streams JSON
under 256 KiB, bounds inline data and display strings, and rejects SVG/HTML
image markup. Confirmed-history NFT display enrichment reads token metadata
through the same bounded configured-RPC transport at the mined block. Durable
history keeps only contract/token identity; the best-effort display cache never
stores token URI and persists only bounded fields plus approved HTTPS image URLs.

## EIP-712 Signature Request Validation

**Files**: stable facade `apps/extension/src/chrome/eip712Validator.ts`; pure
policy implementation `apps/extension/src/chrome/signatures/eip712/`
**Added**: v1.4.0

All `eth_signTypedData_v3` and `eth_signTypedData_v4` requests are validated before processing to prevent denial-of-service attacks from malicious dapps.

### Validation Rules

| Check               | Limit                                         | Purpose                                                 |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Nesting depth       | 50 levels                                     | Prevent stack overflow and DoS from deeply nested types |
| Circular references | None allowed                                  | Prevent infinite recursion in type resolution           |
| Schema structure    | Must have domain, types, primaryType, message | EIP-712 conformance                                     |
| Type definitions    | All referenced types must exist               | Prevent undefined type errors                           |
| Account domain | External V3/V4 verifying contract cannot equal the signer or any stored direct signing EOA | Prevent account execution signatures disguised as messages |

### Attack Scenarios Blocked

1. **Deep nesting DoS**: 60,825 nested types attempting to crash extension
2. **Circular reference DoS**: Types referencing themselves causing infinite loops
3. **Malformed schemas**: Invalid JSON or missing required fields
4. **Account execution-signature phishing**: `PackedUserOperation` and other
   account-domain typed data cannot be signed via generic dapp requests. The
   check is independent of local delegation settings: imported keys retain
   onchain EIP-7702 authority. It covers PK, seed, Ledger, and Bankr EOAs and V3/V4,
   without requiring particular primary types, calldata fields, or RPC probes.

`signatures/externalTypedData.ts` loads the current account list only in the
background and filters to direct signing accounts, matching MetaMask's EOA-only
policy. Safe and view-only records do not add protected addresses; the pinned
signer is always protected. An imported Safe can remain a verifier for external
owner `SafeTx` signatures. There is no `SafeTx` primary-type exemption for EOAs.
General signer classification comes from the exhaustive
`accounts/accountTypePolicy.ts:ACCOUNT_TYPE_CAPABILITIES` table, shared by
pending-account resolution and WalletConnect. A new `AccountType` must declare
its capability row; derived signer types must not be replaced with handwritten
unions or fallback-to-true logic. Direct signing EOAs, including hardware and
remote signers, must enter this protection through the shared guard. A capability
row is classification only: keep auth/session, signer dispatch, and final-release
authorization checks. Review Safe's separate capability matrix when extending
account support. The compiler regression in `tests/accounts/accountTypePolicy.test.ts`
protects missing-row detection and signer-type derivation.
Injected and WalletConnect intake enforce the policy before pending
storage; shared confirmation enforces it for all four signer types and old
pending records, before credential access or device/API calls. Final release
rechecks under the wallet-secret operation lock for account-import races.
Deprecated `eth_sign` and unversioned `eth_signTypedData` are rejected at this
shared boundary too, including old pending records; low-level compatibility
signers must not turn the unversioned alias into a policy bypass. Malformed
field definitions are rejected before delegation/graph inspection, and graph
checks short-circuit on failure.
Ledger final-release authorization failures discard the signature and remove
the pending record, allowing the background to publish a terminal rejection;
pre-sign device/session failures remain retryable.
Neither a spoofed origin/internal label nor the SIWE override grants an exemption.
The content bridge checks the supplied signer only for early surface suppression;
the complete account list is never disclosed to it. Reviewed internal UserOperation
and Safe-owner signing remain separate from this external-request boundary.
No storage keys, secret formats, or signing capabilities are added.

### Validation Flow

```
handleSignatureRequest() → validateEIP712TypedData()
  ├─ Check method (only v3/v4)
  ├─ Parse typed data
  ├─ Validate schema structure
  ├─ Detect circular references (DFS)
  ├─ Check nesting depth
  └─ Validate type definitions
     ↓
if invalid: console.error() + return error to dapp + no popup
if valid: continue to normal flow
```

### Console Logging

Failed validations log to console for debugging:

```
[WalletChan] EIP-712 validation failed for https://malicious.site:
  Type 'Attack' exceeds maximum nesting depth of 50 (found 60825)
```

This helps developers identify malicious sites attempting attacks.

---

## SIWE Signature Request Validation

**Files**:

- `apps/extension/src/lib/siwe/*`
- `apps/extension/src/components/SiweMessageDisplay.tsx`
- `apps/extension/src/components/SiweValidationIssues.tsx`
- `apps/extension/src/chrome/signatures/confirmationPolicy.ts`
- `apps/extension/src/chrome/signatures/confirmationHandlers.ts`

All `personal_sign` messages that match the EIP-4361 SIWE header are parsed and
validated before signing. The popup shows a human-readable auth review, while
`signatures/confirmationPolicy.ts` repeats the same validation at confirm time
for Bankr, private-key, and seed-phrase accounts. The local and Bankr handlers
share that preflight rather than maintaining parallel security checks.

### Blocking Checks

| Check | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Required SIWE fields and field order | Prevent malformed auth messages from being presented as valid logins |
| Account address matches pinned signing account | Prevent signing a login for a different address |
| SIWE chain ID matches connected chain ID | Prevent chain-confusion login messages |
| SIWE domain matches the connected site origin | Prevent a site from requesting login to another domain |
| Expiration / not-before validity | Prevent expired or not-yet-valid login messages |

Warnings such as missing expiration, weak nonce, old issued-at time, insecure
HTTP URI, or non-checksummed address remain visible in the UI but do not block
signing unless they become validation errors.
Nonce weakness uses a 32-bit estimated Shannon-entropy floor together with
explicit common-prefix, sequential-prefix, repeated-run, and repeated-pattern
checks. It does not use a unique-character percentage, which would
systematically misclassify long random hexadecimal nonces.

Users can bypass SIWE validation errors only from the extension UI by opening
the sticky decision-bar warning popover and explicitly checking its
acknowledgement checkbox. This sends `allowUnsafeSiwe` on the extension-only
`confirmSignatureRequest` message and skips only the SIWE validation pass. The
stored pending request, pinned account binding, account type,
and dapp-supplied signer parameter checks still run and are not bypassable by
the SIWE override.

### Validation Flow

```
SignatureRequestConfirmation → analyzeSiweMessage()
  ├─ Display human-readable auth summary
  ├─ Show validation issues
  └─ Require the explicit warning checkbox before signing through errors

handleConfirmSignatureRequest*() → prepareSignatureConfirmation()
  ├─ Re-parse raw personal_sign message
  ├─ Bind to pinned account address, request origin, and request chain ID
  ├─ Reject signing on validation errors unless extension UI override is set
  └─ Revalidate account, origin/WalletConnect, and Bankr credential authority
     after signing and before releasing the signature capability
```

---

## Content Script Message Filtering

Injected account discovery is origin-gated. `eth_accounts` returns an empty
array unless `dappPermissions` contains the exact canonical origin attested by
Chrome's `MessageSender`. The first top-level `eth_requestAccounts` call creates
a persisted confirmation request; background ignores page-claimed origins,
rejects subframe requests, and stores title/favicon only as hostile display
metadata. Address updates always refresh the provider's private internal state,
but `accountsChanged` is emitted only to approved origins. Revocation emits
`accountsChanged([])` to matching open tabs.
The getter-only legacy `window.ethereum.selectedAddress` compatibility field
is derived from that same origin-scoped state and returns `null` for the
unconnected sentinel, malformed values, empty account results, and revocation;
it never reads or exposes the global active-account fallback directly.
Account removal performs that exact-origin revocation before deleting any
account mapped to a connected tab. Since the permission grant is origin-wide,
all open tabs at the affected origin are disconnected; no connected tab is
silently assigned or shown the wallet's next global fallback account. Pending
connection prompts tied to the removed account are terminalized with `4100`,
and connection approval shares the same account-binding lock as removal so it
cannot recreate the grant on the other side of deletion.

The same isolated-world content script may add an extension-origin iframe to a
top-frame `/tx/<hash>` page only after the public URL matches a configured
explorer. The frame receives only that public page URL plus a random
resize-channel token. The exact iframe asks the background to relay only a
bounded height or dismiss action; the top-frame content script accepts that
event only for its active random token. RPC transaction and descriptor data
stay inside the extension iframe and are not forwarded into page-world
JavaScript.

### Inpage-to-Background Messages (via provider/contentBridge)

Only the message types frozen in
`provider/contentBridge/messagePolicy.ts` are accepted from the webpage by the
thin `inject.ts` entrypoint:

| Inpage Message Type       | Background Message / Effect                                      | Purpose |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `i_sendTransaction`       | `sendTransaction`                                                | Transaction request (`from`, `to`, `data`, `value`, `chainId`) |
| `i_signatureRequest`      | `signatureRequest`                                               | Signature request (`method`, `params`, `chainId`) |
| `i_rpcRequest`            | `rpcRequest`                                                     | Allowlisted public read/simulation RPC call through the extension-selected RPC URL |
| `i_switchEthereumChain`   | Updates tab chain state; may send `dappChainSwitchNotification`  | Chain switch request (`chainId`) |
| `i_addEthereumChain`      | `addEthereumChain`                                               | User-confirmed chain add/switch request |
| `i_watchAsset`            | `watchAsset`                                                     | User-confirmed `wallet_watchAsset` request |
| `i_walletGetCapabilities` | `walletGetCapabilities`                                          | ERC-5792 capability query |
| `i_walletSendCalls`       | `walletSendCalls`                                                | ERC-5792 batch request |
| `i_walletGetCallsStatus`  | `walletGetCallsStatus`                                           | ERC-5792 bundle status query |
| `i_walletShowCallsStatus` | `walletShowCallsStatus`                                          | Opens WalletChan status UI for a bundle |
| `i_walletExecutionPermissions` | `walletExecutionPermissions`                                | ERC-7715 delegated-permission discovery, active-grant listing, and user-confirmed request route |

**Source validation**: `contentBridge/messagePolicy.ts` checks
`e.source === window` before dispatch.

For approval-bearing messages only, `contentBridge/requestSurface.ts` may also
send `openProviderRequestSidePanel` synchronously while the original user
activation is live. The effect is presentation-only: the background route
opens the sender tab's side panel and returns no wallet data. It runs only when
the cached non-secret `sidePanelMode` preference is enabled (missing means the
fresh-install default), the browser is not marked as Arc, and the request is an
unconnected `eth_requestAccounts` call, single transaction, ERC-5792 batch,
signature, or
`wallet_requestExecutionPermissions`. `provider/messageValidation.ts` bounds
the route to those exact request-family tags; ERC-7715 discovery/read methods
do not open an approval surface. Non-interactive `eth_accounts` reads and
already-connected account requests also do not open one. The content bridge
first runs the same bounded
provider-envelope validation synchronously against its cached, non-secret
connected-origin state, account address/type, and attested chain. Requests with
invalid payloads, disconnected origins, wrong/stale chains, unsupported batch
versions, ineligible permission account types, or signer/`from` mismatches
never send the early-open message. Typed-data signatures additionally pass the
same bounded EIP-712 schema, raw ERC-7710 delegation, and domain-chain checks
that run before background persistence. ERC-5792 also mirrors wallet/chain,
caller-binding, and unsafe self-recursion checks; ERC-7715 mirrors its
request-only account, chain, address, permission-data, and rule validation
before network eligibility. These checks only suppress presentation for
already-invalid input; the service
worker repeats authorization, account binding, and schema checks as the
authoritative acceptance boundary. Before opening, the service worker records a
ten-second, window-bound hint containing only that request-family tag. Only an
exact trusted WalletChan UI document can consume it through
`getProviderRequestSurfaceHint`; the route returns no request payload, origin,
account, permission terms, or secret. The one-shot hint lives only in service
worker memory and is used solely to keep a cold renderer on its loading screen
until the already-authorized pending-request repository contains the matching
review record. Successful persistence clears any hint the cold renderer did
not already consume.

After a supported `i_switchEthereumChain` request actually changes the tab's
chain, `inject.ts` sends the background-only `dappChainSwitchNotification`
message. That message carries only `chainId`/`chainName`; the background worker
resolves chain metadata from trusted storage, derives the dapp label from the
Chrome sender, rate-limits repeats per tab/origin/chain, and creates a browser
notification. It does not expose secrets or account data.

**Dapp RPC fast path**: `dapp/rpcForwarding.ts` runs entirely in the inpage
script and does not add any new content-script or background message type. It
observes page `fetch` calls to discover HTTP(S) JSON-RPC URLs, validates them
with `eth_chainId`, and forwards only a narrow allowlist of dapp-originated
read methods. Critical wallet data and operations (`wallet_*`, account/chain
state, signing, transaction submission, raw tx broadcast, gas estimation,
nonces, `eth_getCode`/delegation reads, stateful filters, and WalletChan's own
confirmation/simulation flows) must stay on extension-controlled RPC paths.

### Background-to-Content-Script Messages

Only these types are sent to content scripts. The provider-state rows are
eligible for the separate page-world whitelist; the explorer event is consumed
only by the isolated-world injection controller:

| Message Type | Data Sent                                    |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `setAddress` | address, displayAddress                      |
| `setChainId` | chainId                                      |
| `setAccount` | address, displayName, accountId, accountType |
| `EXPLORER_TRANSACTION_FRAME_EVENT` | Random token plus bounded height or dismiss action; no transaction or wallet data |

**Rule**: Never send secrets (passwords, API keys, private keys) to content scripts. Any new background-to-content-script message type must be reviewed for data sensitivity.

**Whitelist enforcement**: `contentBridge/runtimeForwarding.ts` only exposes the
address, account, chain, and explicit permission-revocation events declared in
`messagePolicy.ts`; `getInfo` responds only to the requesting content-script
runtime channel. All other background broadcasts (e.g., `newPendingTxRequest`,
`accountsUpdated`, `txHistoryUpdated`) are **not** forwarded. Configured RPC
URLs are stripped from chain events. This prevents malicious dapps from
eavesdropping on wallet activity across other tabs.

### Sender Verification for Secret-Returning Handlers

Handlers that return secrets or generate sensitive material verify that the sender is a trusted WalletChan UI document (popup, sidepanel, full-screen UI, or onboarding) and not a content script or web-accessible ENS document:

| Handler            | Check                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- |
| `getCachedApiKey`  | `isTrustedWalletUiSender(sender)` |
| `revealPrivateKey` | `isTrustedWalletUiSender(sender)` |
| `revealSeedPhrase` | `isTrustedWalletUiSender(sender)` |
| `generateMnemonic` | `isTrustedWalletUiSender(sender)` |

`isTrustedWalletUiSender()` compares the exact extension scheme, host, and
pathname, and rejects non-top-level frames. Prefix checks are insufficient
because WalletChan intentionally exposes several ENS browsing pages as web
accessible resources.

## Storage Keys Reference

### chrome.storage.local (encrypted secrets)

| Key                        | Contains Secrets | Description                                             |
| -------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `encryptedApiKeyVault`     | Yes (encrypted)  | API key encrypted with vault key                        |
| `encryptedApiKey`          | Yes (encrypted)  | Legacy API key encrypted with password                  |
| `encryptedVaultKeyMaster`  | Yes (encrypted)  | Vault key encrypted with master password                |
| `encryptedVaultKeyAgent`   | Yes (encrypted)  | Vault key encrypted with agent password                 |
| `sessionEncKey`            | Yes (random key half) | AES key for the native unified password/passkey capability (and released-envelope migration). The matching ciphertext is memory-backed in `chrome.storage.session`; fallback browsers never persist either secret half. |
| `passkeyUnlock`            | Yes (encrypted)  | V1 general-key wrapper or V2 purpose-separated general/mnemonic key wrappers |
| `pkVault`                  | Yes (encrypted)  | Private key vault with encrypted entries                |
| `agentPasswordEnabled`     | No               | Boolean flag                                            |
| `mnemonicVault`            | Yes (encrypted)  | V2 dedicated-key-encrypted phrases + master wrapper, or V1 PBKDF2-encrypted phrases |
| `privacyVault`             | Yes (encrypted)  | Exact V1 dedicated-key-encrypted Privacy Pools phrase, authenticated key check, and at least one master/purpose-separated passkey wrapper; a pre-Shield biometric compatibility scaffold may be passkey-only until later main-password rewrap |
| `privacyRecoveryBackup`    | No               | V2 exact `{version, keyId, revision, verifiedAt}` marker written only after successful explicit reveal or restore; V1 key-ID-only records remain readable but cannot authorize replacement; never contains the phrase or an encryption capability |
| `walletHomeModeV1`         | No               | Local presentation choice, exactly `public` or `private`; malformed/missing values resolve to public. It grants no provider, account, privacy, or signing authority. |
| `seedGroups`               | No               | Seed group metadata (names, counts)                     |
| `accounts`                 | No               | Account metadata (addresses, names, types)              |
| `ledgerDevices`            | No               | Public Ledger label/model metadata keyed by the canonical public address at `m/44'/60'/0'/0/0`; no transport secret or private key |
| `addressContacts`          | No               | Local-only user labels for public EVM addresses         |
| `ensIdentityCache`         | No               | Six-hour public name/avatar cache keyed by `chainId:lowercaseAddress`; legacy address-only entries are ignored. `needsAvatar` hints require forward verification before display |
| `networkRpcUrls`           | No               | Bounded Settings-only RPC history keyed by chain ID, including optional display names and an exact per-endpoint `allowImpersonatedTransactions` developer flag. It never changes runtime routing until the selected endpoint is validated and promoted to `networksInfo[*].rpcUrl` through the service worker. |
| `onboardingInitialization` | No               | Temporary `{ version, id, startedAt }` transaction marker for one fresh-wallet setup. Missing is normal; unmarked authoritative key/account state fails closed, disposable residue is cleared before begin, and complete wallets cannot be rolled back because marker cleanup failed. |
| `pendingTxRequests`        | No               | Pending transaction queue                               |
| `pendingSignatureRequests` | No               | Pending signature queue                                 |
| `pendingBatchTxRequests`   | No               | Pending ERC-5792 queue. A newly pinned row may briefly carry non-actionable `intakeStatus: "validating"`; signing and call mutation fail closed until intake removes it, while terminal rejection may remove it safely. |
| `pendingUserOperations`    | No               | Bounded transaction/batch/cross-dapp/Safe ERC-4337 recovery records containing only request family/id, UserOperation hash, public sender, chain, timestamp, and—for cross-dapp recovery—a bounded deduplicated list of public transaction/bundle result IDs. No calldata, signature, authorization, paymaster data, credentials, or keys are persisted. Reset clears the key. |
| `safeProposals`            | No               | Bounded validated Safe proposals, confirmations, public routes, and execution evidence. Token-funded pending execution may add only the deterministic UserOperation hash plus public executor/fee-token metadata; it never stores the UserOperation signature, authorization, quote, paymaster data, private key, or password. |
| `pendingErc7715PermissionRequests` | No        | Pending ERC-7715 delegated-permission prompts pinned to account/origin/chain. Contains requested public authority scope, not private keys. |
| `erc7715PermissionGrants`  | No               | ERC-7715 grant records with returned context and signed ERC-7710 delegation. This is reusable public authority material and must stay origin/account/chain scoped in all listing UI/API paths. |
| `dappPermissions`         | No               | Exact-origin grants allowing injected sites to read the current WalletChan account. Chrome-attested origin is authoritative; title/favicon are untrusted display metadata. |
| `pendingDappConnectionRequests` | No          | Short-lived top-level `eth_requestAccounts` confirmations. Contains origin/tab/frame and public site metadata only; results use `dappConnectionResult:{id}`. |
| `walletConnectPendingRequests` | No           | Bounded WalletConnect request claims/routes plus committed terminal JSON-RPC response metadata (`internal id → session topic/request id`). Never contains private keys, seed phrases, vault keys, or passwords. |
| `walletConnectChainId`    | No               | WalletConnect-specific active chain ID |
| `walletConnectStorageNamespace` | No          | WalletConnect SDK identity epoch. Reset rotates and retains it so a replacement wallet cannot reopen the previous SDK store. |
| `sponsoredTransferIntents` | Yes (encrypted payload) | Bounded ERC-3009 recovery records. The exact signed authorization/nonce is encrypted by the general vault key; unresolved and unacknowledged terminal records survive local-clock expiry until finalized Base state or trusted-UI acknowledgment resolves them. |
| `crossDappBatch`           | No               | User-assembled cross-dapp batch (Bankr or PK/SP EIP-7702). Single batch, locked to first entry's pinned account, `from`, and `chainId`. The original pending entries are removed when added; the dapp promises stay open until ship/reject and are resolved via `txResult:{txId}` or `bundleStatuses` fan-out. |
| `txResult:{txId}`          | No               | Transient tx result (written on confirm/reject, read+deleted by content script) |
| `sigResult:{sigId}`        | No               | Transient sig result (written on confirm/reject, read+deleted by content script) |
| `erc7715PermissionResult:{id}` | No           | Transient ERC-7715 approval result, read+deleted by the waiting injected content script or used by the WalletConnect result bridge |
| `rpcResult:{id}`           | No               | Transient RPC result (written after RPC call, read+deleted by content script)    |
| `txHistory`                | No               | Legacy completed transaction array, read only as an IndexedDB migration source and removed after successful compact import. Exact-bound Shield rows may retain only the bounded public lifecycle projection; public-exit and receiver-paid markers contain no commitment, label, derivation index, note, proof, calldata, or recovery material. |
| `historyNftMetadataCache`  | No               | Best-effort 24-hour NFT display cache (500 entries/10 MiB). Never stores token URI; only public bounded fields and policy-approved HTTPS image URLs persist. |
| `chatHistory`              | No               | Chat conversation history                               |
| `hiddenPortfolioTokens`    | No               | Global list of ERC-20 token keys the user hid from portfolio totals. Contains public token metadata only. |
| `portfolioSnapshotsV2`     | No               | Aggregate USD portfolio chart points keyed by public wallet address, with one-hour deduplication and eight-day retention. Legacy `portfolioSnapshots` data is purge-only because it may contain unrecoverable Tempo sentinel totals. |
| `portfolioHoldingsCache`   | No               | Best-effort reset-aware Holdings display snapshot (`tokens`, DeFi rows, totals, omitted-value metadata, public token metadata, and RPC issue chain IDs). Optional and pruned; contains no credentials or signing material. V3 invalidates older unbounded entries and enforces four entries, 4 MiB total, and 1,000 tokens per snapshot; legacy DOM-localStorage mirrors are purged and never read. |
| `ensAvatarImageCache`      | No               | Best-effort reset-aware cache containing only validated background-decoded/re-encoded raster data URLs plus timing/size metadata; original remote image bytes are not stored. Reset/onboarding invalidates in-flight old-wallet writes. |
| `soundsEnabled`           | No               | Browser-local global interaction-sound preference. Missing values default to enabled; it does not affect authentication or signing behavior. |
| `cs:enabled`               | No               | Clear-signing descriptor fetch opt-out flag             |
| `cs:desc:{chainId}:{address}:{kind}:{selector\|format}` | No | Clear-signing descriptor cache; public metadata only, schema-versioned |

### chrome.storage.session (session-scoped, cleared on browser close)

| Key                        | Contains Secrets | Description                                                      |
| -------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `encryptedSessionCapabilities` | Yes (encrypted) | Current exact V1 payload: 32-byte general key plus optional verified 32-byte privacy key for master sessions. AES-GCM AAD binds session ID, password/passkey method, master/agent type, current factor fingerprint, timeout, lease state, bounded surface IDs, last activity/idle expiry, and privacy key ID. It never contains a password, PRF output, API/private/seed key, mnemonic key/phrase, or privacy recovery phrase. |
| `encryptedSessionPassword` | Yes (encrypted)  | Released password-Never migration input only; current unlocks never write it. |
| `encryptedSessionVaultKey` | Yes (encrypted)  | Released passkey V1/V2 general-key migration input only; current unlocks never write it. |
| `sessionCredentialKind`    | No               | Released-envelope discriminator used only by migration. |
| `sessionId`                | No               | Session identifier (UUID)                                        |
| `sessionStartedAt`         | No               | Session timestamp (milliseconds since epoch)                     |
| `autoLockNever`            | No               | Outer consistency marker; authenticated passkey timing remains authoritative |
| `passwordType`             | No               | `"master" \| "agent"` - which password was used to unlock. Restored to maintain agent password access control guards after service worker restart (v1.3.0+) |
| `privacyPortfolioViewV1`   | No signing secret | Deployment-bound, strictly validated aggregate ready/pending/recoverable balances and at most 193 already-released USD chart points. It intentionally survives automatic auth expiry for read-only Private mode, but explicit lock/reset/recovery replacement and browser shutdown clear it. It contains no commitments, note linkage, depositor, proof, key, phrase, or signing authority. |

### chrome.storage.sync (synced, no secrets)

| Key                                                    | Description                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `address`                                              | Current wallet address               |
| `displayAddress`                                       | Display-friendly address             |
| `chainName`                                            | Shared saved chain context; initializes already-connected injected providers; unconnected pages use mainnet, not a wallet-wide network selector |
| `networksInfo`                                         | Runtime active RPC plus hidden/custom metadata; service-worker-owned mutations |
| `activeAccountId`                                      | Active account ID                    |
| `autoLockTimeout`                                      | Auto-lock timeout (ms)               |
| `tabAccounts`                                          | Connected/pending-dapp-only per-tab account overrides |
| `sidePanelMode` / `isArcBrowser`                       | Active UI windowing settings         |
| `sidePanelVerified`                                    | Released legacy field; retained/reset for compatibility but not read by runtime windowing |
| `hidePortfolioValue`                                   | Boolean - hide/show token USD values |
| `unifyPortfolioBalances`                               | Non-secret boolean display preference; missing or malformed values default to unified balances |
| `followDappNetwork`                                    | Non-secret boolean display preference; missing or malformed values default to following the active dapp network |
| `explorerEnhancementsEnabled`                          | Non-secret block-explorer presentation preference; only exact `false` disables injection, explorer resolution, iframe creation, and its public transaction RPC work |

### IndexedDB (extension-origin, wallet-scoped)

| Database / store | Contains Secrets | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Active operations DB (`walletchan-privacy-v1` Sepolia / `walletchan-privacy-mainnet-v1` mainnet) | Yes (encrypted) | At most 100 exact Shield lifecycle records plus the atomic `nextDepositIndex`. Public summaries contain account/amount/fee/route/state data; deposit index, precommitment, and calldata use fresh-IV AES-GCM under the privacy key with full-summary/key-ID AAD. The unique request-ID index is the sole retry identity; the non-unique account/amount index is correlation metadata and cannot block a fresh request. A pre-effect wallet rejection is marked before pending-request removal, then its encrypted record is deleted without rewinding the derivation cursor; startup performs the same ordered cleanup for rejected rows left by older or interrupted builds. |
| Active commitments DB (`walletchan-privacy-commitments-*-v1`) | Yes (encrypted) | Current commitment hash/value lineage, depositor recovery dependency, status, and derivation indexes with revision-bound AAD. Only aggregate balances leave the background. |
| Active withdrawals DB (`walletchan-privacy-withdrawals-*-v1`) | Yes (encrypted) | At most 256 restart-safe Unshield intents; commitment linkage, expected nullifier/replacement, signed quote, and relayer payload remain encrypted. |
| Active ragequits DB (`walletchan-privacy-ragequits-*-v1`) | Yes (encrypted) | At most 256 original-depositor public-recovery intents and proof calldata; optional same-account batch IDs are public AAD-bound routing metadata. Renderer receives only bounded public recovery activity, with user-rejected prompts omitted after their claims are safely released. |
| Active portfolio DB (`walletchan-privacy-portfolio-*-v1`) | Yes (encrypted) | At most 193 eight-day private balance/price/USD points. Values use fresh-IV AES-GCM under the dedicated privacy key with record/key/timestamp-bound AAD; only identifiers and creation time remain public metadata. |
| Active events DB (`walletchan-privacy-events-*-v1`) | No | Disposable bounded public Deposited/Withdrawn/Ragequit logs plus an active-profile checkpoint; rebuilt from the pinned pool and never treated as note authority without local derivation checks. |

The `*-mainnet-v1` spellings are exact mainnet names; Sepolia retains the
released names without an inserted profile token. Reset and recovery
replacement delete both profiles' encrypted databases so inactive-profile
secrets cannot survive wallet replacement.

| `manifest_version`         | 3                                                            | MV3 enforces CSP, no `eval()`, no remote code                                  |
| `permissions`              | `activeTab`, `alarms`, `favicon`, `storage`, `sidePanel`, `notifications`, `offscreen`, `tabs`, `declarativeNetRequestWithHostAccess`, `unlimitedStorage` | No `webRequest`, no `debugger`; `alarms` wakes pending Shield compliance refreshes and Safe synchronization only for bounded lifecycle work. Chromium offscreen documents isolate both the Ledger WebHID SDK and the bounded packaged privacy proof worker; Firefox omits unsupported offscreen use. `favicon` reads Chrome's processed icon for exact local IPFS/IPNS and approved ENS/GNS/onchain gateway pages; `unlimitedStorage` protects wallet-critical writes from optional cache growth. |
| `host_permissions`         | `https://*/*`, `http://*/*`                                  | Broad, needed for content-script coverage and configured RPCs; egress is method/URL/origin/redirect/timeout/size/concurrency bounded |
| `content_scripts.matches`  | All URLs                                                     | Wallet must inject on all pages for dapp detection                             |
| `externally_connectable`   | Not defined                                                  | External websites cannot send messages to background                           |
| `web_accessible_resources` | Provider `inpage.js`; three packaged brand images; four exact ENS browsing HTML entrypoints in the Chrome manifest | The provider/assets are page-facing by design. ENS HTML is untrusted extension UI, exposes no JS bundle through WAR, and is authorized only for its exact message/page combinations; `isTrustedWalletUiSender()` never treats it as popup/onboarding UI. The Firefox manifest exposes only the provider/assets group. |
| `content_security_policy`  | `script-src 'self' 'wasm-unsafe-eval'; object-src 'self'; worker-src 'self'` | Allows only packaged scripts/workers plus WebAssembly compilation; no inline script, `eval()`, Blob worker, or remote code |

The offscreen page and its generated worker bundle are packaged extension
resources and are not web accessible. Every offscreen page URL carries a fresh
random request nonce, and its one-shot message is accepted only from the exact
background service-worker URL with that nonce. The worker accepts one
fixed self-test action, has a two-minute hard deadline, and is terminated after
every result or failure. It returns no proofs or public signals to the UI.
Real proof requests may retry once with a newly created offscreen document.
This boundary is side-effect-free: no RPC, signing, transaction, or persisted
operation effect occurs until a locally verified proof has returned.
Prover debugging is restricted to fixed stage/action/attempt/failure-code
console entries. Proof inputs and results, public account/deposit fields,
addresses, amounts, labels, commitments, nullifiers, and secrets are forbidden
from diagnostic output.

The six Privacy Pools circuit files are packaged extension resources but are
not listed in `web_accessible_resources`. The build verifies their pinned sizes
and SHA-256 digests before packaging; the Chrome-only protocol loader accepts
only the extension origin and repeats both checks before returning bytes. No
runtime CDN or alternate artifact URL is permitted.

## Security Invariants

These must always hold true. Violations indicate a security bug.

1. **Stored private keys and mnemonics leave the service worker only through an explicit trusted-UI secret flow** - Persisted secrets are decrypted in `sessionCache.ts` / `mnemonicStorage.ts`, used for signing in `txHandlers.ts` / `localSigner.ts`, and never sent to content scripts or webpages. Password-gated, agent-blocked `revealPrivateKey` / `revealSeedPhrase` responses may return a stored secret only to an exact top-level WalletChan UI document. A newly generated or imported secret necessarily exists in that trusted renderer while the user records or reviews it; generated recovery material is staged there and is not persisted until the user acknowledges backup and explicitly saves it.
   Secret import/display controls disable spellcheck, autocorrect,
   capitalization, and autocomplete so pasted recovery material is not offered
   to browser or operating-system text services.
   Bankr API-key drafts are also cleared from renderer state on every manual,
   automatic, or externally broadcast lock, so a draft created under master
   authorization cannot reappear after an agent-password unlock.

2. **No secrets in console logs** - Never `console.log` passwords, API keys, private keys, or vault keys. Grep for `console.log` near sensitive variables when reviewing changes.

3. **Agent password blocks all account/secret modifications** - Every handler that modifies secrets or account structure checks `getPasswordType() === "agent"` and returns an error. The UI hides these options too, but backend enforcement is the true security boundary.

3a. **Ledger keys never enter extension memory or storage** - The offscreen
   Ledger SDK receives unsigned transaction/message/typed-data payloads and
   returns only public addresses or signatures. Account persistence contains
   public device/path metadata only. Every signing session re-identifies the
   device, and the service worker locally recovers the returned signature before
   broadcast/release. Adding Ledger accounts is master-only; normal signing may
   use a live master or agent session. Ledger pairing/scan routes are exact
   trusted-wallet-UI messages, not provider messages. Pending Ledger requests
   reach the offscreen signer only from the exact extension service-worker
   sender URL and extension ID; content scripts, renderer pages, foreign IDs,
   query/hash variants, and path lookalikes are rejected before dispatch.
   Ledger account/device persistence is the durable import commit, while the
   subsequent active-account preference update is best-effort and cannot
   produce a false failed-import response after data was committed.
   During fresh-wallet onboarding, WebHID discovery occurs before credential
   creation but retains public selection metadata only. The account/device
   write is deferred until the master credential is initialized under the
   active onboarding marker, so the existing rollback removes any partial
   credential and Ledger metadata together.
   Fee-payment capability discovery rejects Ledger before inspecting any
   onchain delegate, so even a pre-delegated address cannot enter the ERC-4337
   token-funded gas path that has no hardware signing implementation.
   Safe owner approval sends only the locally rebuilt, chain-bound SafeTx
   EIP-712 payload through this same recovered-signer boundary. Native-gas Safe
   execution sends only the exact outer `execTransaction` envelope through the
   existing recovered raw-transaction boundary; token-funded Safe execution
   remains rejected before quote consumption because it requires EIP-7702.
   Pending Ledger requests
   remain durable during the hardware prompt, but the existing synchronous
   first-action claim blocks confirm/edit/reject races across popup, side panel,
   and full-page renderers. Transaction removal and Activity creation occur
   only after recovered-signer and final-authorization checks in the
   pre-broadcast callback; signature removal occurs only after those same final
   release checks. Renderer-side edit locks are UX defense-in-depth, not the
   concurrency boundary.

4. **Encryption uses fresh randomness** - Every encryption operation generates a new random salt and IV. Never reuse salt/IV pairs.

5. **Service worker suspend clears plaintext memory** - `background/lifecycle/maintenance.ts`, registered by lifecycle composition, calls `clearInMemoryAuthCache()`, which clears the API key, password, private-key vault, general/privacy/mnemonic keys, password type, and session ID together. An eligible split native-session capability may rehydrate afterward only through the restoration policy below.

6. **Timed auto-lock clears every in-memory credential after wallet-surface inactivity** - All cached credential getters, including `getCachedVaultKey()`, `getCachedMnemonicKey()`, `getCachedPrivacyKey()`, and `getPasswordType()`, enforce one coherent lease. Any registered trusted popup, side panel, or full-page wallet surface pauses finite expiry; the last close starts the configured timer. Expiry clears the API key, password, private-key vault, every cached key, and password type together.
   Missing or invalid settings resolve to the finite 15-minute default and are
   initialized on install/update. Only an exact stored `0` enables Never.
   Registration evaluates any previous idle deadline before adding presence,
   so opening a surface cannot revive an expired capability.

7. **Unified restoration is lease-, factor-, and policy-bound** -
   `tryRestoreSession()` re-reads the authoritative timeout before restoration.
   The V1 unified envelope authenticates session ID, unlock method,
   master/agent type, current wrapper/passkey fingerprint, timeout, lease
   state, bounded renderer IDs, last active time, exact idle expiry, and
   privacy-key identity as AES-GCM AAD. The same persisted renderer ID may prove
   continuous presence across a worker restart. Without that match, an active
   record is treated conservatively as closed at its last authenticated
   heartbeat and an idle record must satisfy `Date.now() < idleExpiresAt`.
   Every heartbeat/lease rewrite uses a fresh IV. Any timeout change revokes
   the old envelope.
   After the authoritative timeout read, a coherent live authorization
   generation makes restoration an idempotent success: no persisted envelope
   is consumed, no unlock callback runs, no auth epoch rotates, and a fresh V2
   passkey session retains its live-only mnemonic key. A null cached plaintext
   password alone is never treated as a lost session because passkey master
   sessions are passwordless by design.
   Cold passkey restoration intentionally omits the mnemonic key. Seed setup,
   import, preview, derive, and persistence must query the live capability and
   complete a fresh WebAuthn assertion before continuing; persisted V2 record
   capability alone is not sufficient.
   Password and passkey restoration require native
   memory-backed `chrome.storage.session` (available in WalletChan's supported
   Chrome and Firefox versions). The fallback for browsers/forks without it
   stores only non-secret state; old fallback password/vault ciphertext and key
   halves are proactively removed, and both finite and Never sessions relock
   after a worker restart.
   Native unified envelopes are exact-field and allocation-bounded before
   base64 decoding: recovery key and IV are exactly 32 and 12 bytes; plaintext
   is exactly 32 bytes for general-only or 64 bytes for general+privacy, plus
   the AES-GCM tag. Agent records with privacy material fail closed. Current
   factor fingerprints must match, and the restored general/private capability
   must pass normal vault/privacy integrity checks. Malformed, ambiguous,
   stale, tampered, or torn records return locked and delete both recovery
   halves. The decrypted capability crosses restoration only as a
   symbol-branded, non-enumerable call-stack object, so a runtime message or
   structured clone cannot forge it. Released password-Never/passkey records
   are read only for one-time migration; a released passkey record cannot cold
   restore a configured Shield identity without a fresh assertion.

7a. **Factor removal revokes restoration before commit** - Passkey and agent
   removal first prove master recovery, including the privacy key/recovery when
   `privacyVault` exists. A passkey-only compatibility record must still have
   its matching live privacy capability; the explicit verified main password
   adds the master wrapper before the passkey wrapper is removed. The handler
   then removes the local `sessionEncKey`
   half before deleting the factor. Failure to revoke leaves the factor
   untouched. Once the factor commit succeeds, in-memory authority is cleared
   synchronously; failure to clear the remaining native ciphertext cannot
   restore a session because its key half is already gone. Password rotation
   changes the master wrapper and clears the agent wrapper atomically, so an
   old envelope is non-restorable even if post-commit residue cleanup fails.

8. **Content script only forwards whitelisted message types** - `inject.ts` only bridges the documented dapp-facing allowlist from page to background: transaction/signature requests, RPC proxy calls, chain add/switch/watch-asset prompts, and ERC-5792 capability/batch/status methods. In the reverse direction, only `setAddress`, `setChainId`, and `setAccount` are forwarded from background to the webpage.

9. **No `eval()` or dynamic code execution** - MV3 CSP prevents this, but also verify no `new Function()` or similar patterns exist.

10. **Secret-returning handlers verify sender origin** - Handlers like `getCachedApiKey`, `revealPrivateKey`, `revealSeedPhrase`, and `generateMnemonic` check `isTrustedWalletUiSender(sender)` to require top-level `index.html` / `onboarding.html`, not a content script or web-accessible ENS page.

10a. **Explicit master verification proves current recovery** - Key/phrase
    reveal and biometric setup do not accept wrapper decryption alone. The
    candidate general key must recover the current Bankr credential and every
    local account binding, and V2 mnemonic recovery/key-check verification must
    succeed. A validly encrypted replacement wrapper around an unrelated key
    therefore cannot authorize secrets already cached by a biometric session.

10b. **Plaintext reveal is linearized with auth teardown** -
    `secrets/revealHandlers.ts` (behind the stable
    `secretRevealHandlers.ts` facade) captures the current authentication epoch before
    explicit master verification, then owns the wallet-secret operation lock
    through the final session/epoch recheck, decryption, and synchronous
    `sendResponse` invocation. A manual/automatic lock, password rotation,
    factor removal, or reset that wins first yields no key or phrase; if reveal
    wins first, its response is emitted before the queued teardown completes.
    Passkey password preflight uses the same capture-before-verify rule so a
    concurrent lock cannot be adopted as a fresh setup epoch.

11. **Password change proves recovery before clearing factors, then writes atomically** - `handleChangePassword` re-verifies the explicit master password. It requires the unwrapped general key to be exactly 32 bytes, recover a non-empty stored Bankr credential, decrypt every `pkVault` entry, and reproduce every current private-key/seed account address. For V2 it also unwraps the mnemonic key through the master wrapper, validates every BIP39 phrase and seed-group record, and re-derives every seed-account address. A present `privacyVault` must independently authenticate and decrypt before its unchanged privacy key is rewrapped. A passkey-only compatibility record additionally requires the matching raw privacy capability from the live fresh biometric session; otherwise rotation fails without changing any factor. Only then does rotation prepare new wrappers, finish residual legacy API/`pkVault` migrations, and clear agent/passkey wrappers in one `chrome.storage.local.set()`. A corrupt or mismatched-but-decryptable wrapper therefore preserves the old password and passkey instead of destroying the last working recovery factor. V1 phrases are re-encrypted in memory; current general-vault, V2 mnemonic, and privacy recovery ciphertext remain unchanged.

11a. **The released private-key vault is bounded without a format migration** -
    `vault/recordCodec.ts` rejects unknown versions, malformed AES-GCM fields,
    more than 10,000 entries, and IDs longer than 512 characters before
    cryptographic work. Structurally valid V1 duplicate IDs remain readable to
    avoid locking out an existing race-affected profile, but every save,
    add/remove, and password/vault-key migration preparation rejects them with
    zero writes. Frozen released V1 ciphertext remains byte-for-byte unchanged.

12. **Duplicate-only seed imports do not persist secrets** - `addSeedPhraseGroup` validates that at least one selected derivation index can be imported or converted before creating `seedGroups` metadata or writing the encrypted mnemonic to `mnemonicVault`.

12a. **Seed persistence cannot silently generate recovery material** - The
    extension-only `generateMnemonic` response is staged in renderer memory and
    shown for backup first. `addSeedPhraseGroup` requires that phrase as input;
    a missing phrase fails instead of creating a persisted, unacknowledged
    recovery secret.

12b. **Fresh onboarding never guesses that recovery material is disposable** -
    `onboarding/state.ts` owns the frozen marker codec, authoritative-data
    classification, completeness proof, and rollback cleanup;

    `onboarding/lifecycle.ts` owns marker transitions without cryptography; and
    `onboarding/credential.ts` owns only the marker-bound first encrypted
    credential commit. `onboardingInitialization.ts` is an export-only facade.
    Credentials, general/agent/passkey wrappers, PK/mnemonic vaults, account
    rows, and seed-group metadata are the authoritative unmarked-state boundary.
    Any such partial state is preserved and requires explicit recovery/reset.
    With no authoritative state, begin clears stale grants, pending/result
    routes, wallet-scoped caches, session recovery, and account mirrors, then
    tears down WalletConnect sessions/pairings and rotates the SDK namespace
    before writing the setup marker. A failed namespace cutover writes no marker
    or credential, and harmless ENS/avatar preview caches cannot block setup.

12c. **Legacy account migration is linearizable** - `onInstalled` and the
    renderer fallback share the wallet secret-operation lock and re-read inside
    it before creating the v0.x Bankr account. Only one generated account ID can
    commit. If an older build already left a stale or missing `activeAccountId`, active
    account resolution repairs it to the first intact account while preserving
    every valid Bankr/private-key/seed selection. Malformed legacy EVM addresses
    leave the encrypted credential untouched and create no account row.

12d. **Privacy recovery is independent and explicit-release-only** - First eligible Private-mode entry
    may generate one separate 12-word Privacy Pools phrase only inside the
    service worker, under the wallet-secret lock and a live password or fresh
    biometric master auth epoch. A successful assertion from a biometric
    factor that predates Shield may first create an empty passkey-only vault;
    it contains no phrase until a custody account enters Private mode. The exact
    `privacyVault` codec requires at least one valid recovery wrapper, rejects
    malformed or oversized records, and never overwrites invalid storage.
    Ordinary Shield routes return only public status. The one exception is
    `privacyRevealRecovery`, which requires an explicitly entered current main
    password and returns plaintext only to the exact trusted Settings document.
    Successful reveal/restore writes only a key-ID-and-vault-revision-bound
    non-secret backup marker. Replacing an existing phrase additionally
    requires that exact marker and both explicit loss acknowledgements. Restore
    validates BIP-39 before authorization or storage mutation, preserves the
    dedicated privacy-key capability, commits a new versioned identity under
    the wallet-secret lock, and deletes only rebuildable privacy indexes. A
    cleanup failure restores the previous encrypted vault record; the Settings
    renderer starts a bounded rescan only after restore succeeds.
    The renderer's Public/Private presentation toggle grants no authority and
    does not wait for initialization; it only sends the existing trusted-UI
    request, whose background gates remain authoritative. Agent sessions and
    active impersonator accounts cannot create, reveal,
    restore, or rescan the phrase; repeat initialization is a byte-for-byte
    no-op once initialized.

12e. **Privacy protocol dependencies are fixed and non-custodial** -
    `privacy-pools.protocol.json` pins the exact official SDK version, npm
    integrity, tarball digest, upstream commit, empty patch list, and all six
    circuit artifact hashes. `privacy/protocol/primitives.ts` exposes only
    bounded derivation/commitment operations; SDK private-key contract helpers,
    RPC clients, and submission helpers are outside the WalletChan boundary.
    The background build resolves the SDK import to the same pinned package's
    pure `src/crypto.ts` source because its published root barrel eagerly
    evaluates `snarkjs`/`ffjavascript` Blob-worker setup that MV3 service
    workers do not support. A post-bundle guard rejects those worker markers;
    the proof dependency remains confined to the offscreen worker build. The
    manifest separately pins `poseidon-lite@0.3.0` and widths `[1, 2, 3]` as
    the service-worker hashing adapter. Differential and fixed vectors match
    the official SDK, while the build rejects the dependency that eagerly
    parses unused all-width Poseidon parameters on every worker wake.
    `privacy/protocol/artifacts.ts` rejects wrong origins, byte lengths, or
    digests and has no remote fallback. The offscreen bridge accepts only one
    fixed public self-test or one exact bounded real proof request through a
    nonce-bound internal message.
    Its packaged worker forces the pinned `snarkjs@0.7.5` prover and verifier
    onto supported
    single-thread curves, avoiding the upstream Blob-worker default prohibited
    by MV3 CSP. Real commitment/withdrawal circuit inputs reach only this
    one-shot worker, which locally verifies the proof before returning bounded
    proof/signals to the service worker. Phrase and wallet keys never enter it.
    A failed real proof request gets one clean offscreen-document retry; the
    packaged browser rehearsal also exercises this normal requested-proof path.
    `privacy-prover.budgets.json` is enforced after every extension build and
    caps the clean package, raw artifacts, prover worker, background bundle,
    first/restart self-test duration, Chromium process-tree peak RSS delta, and
    proof concurrency. The packaged Chromium rehearsal enforces both duration
    and memory across a closed/reopened extension page. The v4 licensing
    decision covers the extension under GPL-3.0-only and preserves
    `snarkjs@0.7.5` attribution. Every build packages the full GPL text,
    third-party notices, and exact-version source directions. Release/store zip
    commands require extension version 4.0.0 or later.

12f. **Privacy deployment support is an exact fail-closed allowlist** - The
    official Privacy Pools app commit, Sepolia/mainnet chains, ETH pools, scopes,
    deployment block, Entrypoint proxy and EIP-1967 implementation, both
    verifiers, asset config, and all five runtime bytecode identities are
    immutable release pins under `privacy/deployment/`. The runtime verifies
    the onchain fields before proving. The official website's app-only `1 ETH`
    setting is not an onchain constraint and is deliberately not enforced;
    quote amounts remain `uint256`-valid, minimum-bound, balance-bound, and
    gas-aware. ERC-20 deployments remain absent. The build scripts select one
    immutable profile at compile time with no runtime or remote override:
    normal dev/production commands use `mainnet-production`, while the dedicated
    Sepolia commands use `sepolia-local-beta`. Profile-isolated IndexedDB names
    prevent Sepolia and mainnet lineage from mixing. Bankr remains blocked on Sepolia; mainnet
    Bankr submission uses the same pinned privacy authorization immediately
    before its irreversible effect boundary. RPC
    unavailability or any drift returns only a bounded generic retry status to
    the renderer.

12g. **Shield review intent cannot become an implicit transaction** -
    `privacy/deposit/intent.ts` creates one exact active-chain native-deposit call
    with the ABI encoder, then independently checks the selector, one-word
    precommitment argument, source, pinned Entrypoint, chain, transaction
    value, onchain fee math, and protocol scalar bounds without using that
    decoder. The type is fixed to `submittable: false`; the final uint32
    derivation index is reserved for this disposable review and is neither
    stored nor returned. The separate `privacy/operations/` type repeats the
    checks, reserves a distinct index in `0..0xfffffffe`, encrypts its index,
    precommitment, and calldata, and atomically persists that record with the
    next-index counter. Renderer data remains `submittable: false`; only the
    background can create its trusted account-pinned normal confirmation. The
    local transaction path repeats the encrypted intent/deployment/account/auth
    checks immediately before raw RPC publication. Receipt handling accepts only
    the exact ETH-pool event. The trusted renderer receives balance aggregates
    only: total value confirmed in the pinned pool, the subset locally verified
    as privately withdrawable, the subset awaiting ASP review, and publicly
    recoverable value scoped to the active original depositor. Newly confirmed
    operation sidecars are de-duplicated
    against encrypted commitments by public source-operation ID; no label,
    commitment, precommitment, derivation index, or account inventory is added
    to the response. An exact operation/transaction/account/chain/value binding
    may mirror only `{version, operationId, state, updatedAt, amountWei,
    shieldedAmountWei}` onto the normal transaction-history row so main
    Activity can render the current stage. Matching transaction-history
    notifications only trigger a bounded reload/sync and convey no Shield
    secret. A one-shot MV3 alarm may restore an eligible browser session, but
    does not depend on it: the public operation sidecar is sufficient to bind
    the returned deposit and locally verify both Merkle memberships against the
    onchain association root and a known pool state root. That locked-safe path
    may advance only to `asp_approved`; it cannot derive private note lineage or
    spendable balance. The first atomic `asp_approved` transition emits one
    native notification whose generic copy contains no amount, account, chain,
    label, commitment, or other Shield metadata. `private_ready` still requires
    the authenticated privacy key and full secret-derived lineage verification.
    The alarm reschedules only for pending/retry/Proof-of-Association states.
    A pre-effect Shield rejection removes the pending request before
    deleting its encrypted operation, while its already-advanced derivation
    cursor is never rewound. A user-rejected public-withdrawal record remains
    encrypted in the background long enough to release its commitment claim safely, but
    `privacyListShieldOperations` omits that `wallet_rejected` projection from
    user-facing Activity. This presentation filter does not delete or disguise
    genuine proof, submission, revert, ambiguity, or recovery failures.

12h. **Private exits and public recovery retain separate authorities** -
    Unshield verifies a pinned relayer's EIP-712 signer, bounded response,
    recipient, fee math, expiry, ASP/state roots and membership, local proof,
    all public signals, and the auth epoch immediately before POST. The durable
    state moves to submission-unknown before that irreversible boundary, and
    restart recovery uses receipt plus nullifier state instead of blind retry.
    A cold privacy key does not block receipt observation: the public Withdrawn
    event must match the durable amount and pinned Entrypoint processooor before
    the operation reaches `public_confirmed`. Secret spent-nullifier and
    replacement-commitment reconciliation remains unlock-gated and alone may
    advance `private_balance_updated`.
    Receiver-paid Unshield skips the relayer but not these proof or membership
    checks. Its exact recipient-owned signer pays gas and is the public
    `processooor`; normal transaction confirmation is mandatory, all three
    signing account types reuse their existing pinned paths, impersonators are
    rejected, and Sepolia Bankr mutation remains disabled. A direct receipt is
    accepted only when amount, recipient processooor, spent nullifier, and new
    commitment match the encrypted intent.
    ASP and materialization status writes are guarded by the exact encrypted
    commitment revision and status they inspected. They cannot replay a stale
    eligibility decision over a newer Unshield or ragequit claim; exit claims
    and releases use the same compare-and-set boundary.
    Every relayed, receiver-paid, and ragequit preparation also derives the
    selected note's current one-input nullifier hash and reads the pool's
    `nullifierHashes` mapping before proof generation and immediately before
    the encrypted claim. A spent note, an invalid local derivation, or an RPC
    failure is fail-closed as bounded balance synchronization; stale local
    state cannot proceed to gas simulation or publication.
    The ASP root must equal `Entrypoint.latestRoot()`; the state root must
    equal the pool's current root or one of the remaining 63 entries in its
    64-slot root history, matching the contract's exact latest-ASP/known-state
    acceptance rules. Both conditions are re-read immediately before relayer
    submission. Public recovery is offered as soon as an exact confirmed
    deposit is indexed, including while ASP review is pending, when Proof of
    Association is required, after decline/removal, and when its ASP
    endpoint/root cannot currently be verified. Pending review or ASP outage
    never grants private spendability. Local commitment materialization runs
    before ASP transport and repeats at the public-recovery preparation boundary;
    the renderer may keep the action visible from the bounded account-bound
    indexed-operation summary, but that summary cannot authorize proof or
    signing. Transaction-detail recovery additionally sends the bounded source
    Shield operation ID; the background matches it against the decrypted
    commitment's `sourceOperationId` and never falls back to a different
    deposit. A successful ASP response that omits a newly confirmed label is
    treated only as not-yet-indexed and remains pending. ASP transport,
    malformed/injected response, deposit-binding, or local verification
    failures are projected internally as retryable `asp_unavailable`, not as
    an ASP compliance decision;
    `poi_required` is projected separately as action required. A transient
    refresh failure does not erase previously verified private-ready
    membership. Background diagnostics log only controlled phase names and
    aggregate counts, never labels, commitments, transaction hashes, accounts,
    or amounts. Recovery requires the exact original
    depositor, verifies the current partial-withdrawal
    lineage and four commitment signals, then uses the same trusted local
    confirmation boundary. Commitment-signal binding distinguishes the deposit
    precommitment `Poseidon(nullifier, secret)` from the spent-nullifier hash
    `Poseidon(nullifier)` and checks the exact circuit order against the pinned
    artifacts. Rejection restores the claimed commitment's prior ASP status.
    An atomic same-account batch binds 2–8 distinct commitments to one immutable
    operation-ID/call order and cannot be edited, split, or paid through an
    alternate fee path. Success decodes every Ragequit log and requires a
    one-to-one exact event match before each source activity becomes terminal.
    Agent and impersonator accounts fail before
    relayer quote/proof publication or signing. Sepolia Bankr accounts also
    fail before mutation. Production Bankr, private-key, seed-phrase, and Ledger
    accounts may act only for an exact pinned original depositor.
    Private-key/seed accounts share one bounded raw-RPC path, Bankr uses its
    separately authorized submission path, and Ledger uses its guarded
    single-transaction hardware path. Ledger cannot enter the atomic
    multi-commitment batch path.
    Local note records are canonicalized by immutable deposit lineage and the
    greatest withdrawal index. Same-index commitment forks fail closed;
    materialization cannot recreate a superseded index-zero note for an already
    represented Shield operation. When the confirmation-safe event cache is
    current, authenticated sync deterministically follows every Withdrawn and
    Ragequit event to reconstruct the current note, preserves the source
    operation binding, and quarantines only strictly older indices. Receipt
    recovery runs before ASP refresh, so ASP transport or duplicate-label
    failures cannot strand an already-confirmed receiver-paid operation.

12i. **Account removal and reset cannot silently orphan Shield funds** -
    Account deletion checks Shield safety once before any dapp revocation and
    again inside the final account/secret mutation lock. Pending or ambiguous
    deposits, in-flight public recovery, every unspent commitment, or an
    existing privacy identity whose key cannot be authenticated blocks the
    deletion. Reset exposes only a public `{hasShieldData, backupVerified}`
    preflight and requires an exact boolean acknowledgement when Shield data
    exists before installing the destructive barrier. The reset manifest owns
    `privacyVault`, `privacyRecoveryBackup`, deletion of both profiles'
    encrypted privacy databases, and the active disposable event database; a
    renderer cannot narrow that deletion set.

13. **Signing confirmation preserves explicit user control** -
    `handleConfirmTransaction`, `handleConfirmTransactionAsync`, and
    `transactions/localConfirmation.ts:handleConfirmTransactionAsyncPK` do not
    reject a transaction because of request age. Signature confirmation,
    ERC-5792 Bankr/PK/seed confirmation, and cross-dapp batch confirmation apply
    the same rule. Injected transaction/signature/batch result listeners are
    unbounded, and periodic maintenance does not sweep `pendingTxRequests`,
    `pendingSignatureRequests`, or `pendingBatchTxRequests`. WalletConnect keeps
    unresolved transaction/signature routes without an age limit. Prompts
    remain reviewable until confirm, reject, authorization/session
    cancellation, account removal, or reset resolves them.
    The local handler still resolves only the account
    pinned at intake, verifies `tx.from`, restores the PK/seed key through the
    existing master/agent/restorable-session paths, removes the prompt, revalidates
    live request authority, and transfers reset exclusion to an effect lease.
    `transactions/localExecution.ts` signs once and rechecks the exact account,
    dapp/WalletConnect authority, and any persistent EIP-7702 master epoch in
    `beforeBroadcast`, immediately before signed bytes cross the RPC boundary.
    A preparation failure releases the lease; a failure after that boundary
    remains fail-closed because the broadcast outcome may be ambiguous.

14. **Pending requests resolve first-action-wins** -
    `requests/pendingRequestResolution.ts` synchronously claims a transaction,
    signature, ERC-5792 batch, dapp connection queue, or cross-dapp batch before
    deferring any asynchronous work. Confirm and reject share the claim across
    popup/side-panel/full-page surfaces and across Bankr, private-key,
    seed-phrase, and legacy transaction routes. A terminal resolver removes the
    durable pending item before releasing its in-memory claim; every late
    reject/confirm checks for that tombstone and cannot overwrite the terminal
    result. Recoverable pre-effect failures remain pending and may retry.
    Editing/splitting shares that namespace, and a move into the cross-dapp
    batch claims both the source and destination atomically so it cannot race a
    direct submission.
    Unexpected exceptions retain the claim fail-closed because an external
    signer or RPC may have accepted an operation even when its response was
    lost. `processingTxIds` and `processingBundleIds` remain secondary guards,
    not the resolution boundary. No user-review prompt has periodic age-based
    expiry: transactions, signatures, ERC-5792 batches, cross-dapp batches,
    dapp connections, add-chain prompts, watch-asset prompts, and ERC-7715
    permission requests remain pending for the user's decision. Only
    pre-prompt transport claims and already-terminal response records retain
    bounded cleanup.
    Background transaction/batch processors and signature signers hold an
    effect lease after durable removal through their last-safe-point transport
    authorization check. The lease is released for provably pre-publication
    failures and definitive transport responses, but retained fail-closed when
    a signer or RPC response is lost after publication may have begun. Wallet
    reset owns a mutually exclusive global barrier
    before authentication or destructive storage awaits and returns a visible
    conflict instead of racing any active effect. Direct internal swap/bridge,
    atomic EIP-7702 swap, and sponsored-transfer signing/submission use the same
    barrier; fire-and-forget internal processors transfer ownership to an
    effect lease before their router claim is released.
    External pending records must retain Chrome-attested injected provenance,
    exact WalletConnect routing metadata, or an explicit service-worker-only
    `trustedInternal` marker; missing legacy provenance fails closed. Moved
    cross-dapp entries preserve that metadata, are cancelled by exact origin or
    session topic, and collectively commit captured revocation/termination
    epochs synchronously before submission so revoking source A while source B
    is still validating cannot leak A into the batch effect.

14a. **Bankr identity cannot drift after review** - A Bankr prompt stores a
    non-secret hash of the current encrypted API-key ciphertext generation.
    Final authorization requires the same generation for injected,
    WalletConnect, internal, and cross-dapp paths; old tagless Bankr prompts
    fail closed. Credential/address changes are verified by locally recovering
    a harmless personal-sign challenge, then written atomically. The extension
    permits only one newly added Bankr row because the key is wallet-wide;
    legacy multi-row profiles remain readable, while each submit preflight
    proves the key controls the pinned row before `/wallet/submit` is invoked.
    After that challenge, submit holds the wallet-secret operation lock,
    rechecks account + transport + credential generation, and starts fetch
    before releasing the lock. Credential rotation during the challenge cannot
    pass. Signatures are rechecked after signing and discarded if authority
    changed before release.

14b. **Local RPC broadcasts are authorization- and ambiguity-safe** - PK and
    seed transactions are prepared and signed once, then derive their hash
    locally from the serialized bytes. Immediately before the first raw RPC
    send, an after-sign hook re-resolves the pinned account and performs the
    final injected/WalletConnect authorization check (or the cross-dapp epoch
    commit) before beginning the effect. Revocation, navigation, disconnect,
    account removal, or reset during slow preparation therefore prevents the
    signed bytes from leaving the service worker. The wallet-secret operation
    lock spans preparation, final validation, and raw send, excluding account
    removal/conversion and auth-session mutations from that last boundary.
    Sync-send fallback retries
    only the identical serialized bytes. Once any raw send is attempted, a
    timeout or disconnect is never treated as proof of failure: tx history
    retains the deterministic hash with `broadcastUncertain`, receipt polling
    does not mark repeated unobserved reads as dropped, and ordered batch/swap/
    force-inclusion paths stop their higher-nonce tail. This avoids duplicate
    execution through a user retry while still allowing eventual receipt
    reconciliation.

    The force-inclusion audit domain keeps these boundaries independently
    reviewable: `singleLocal.ts` owns the final account/request check and
    sign-once broadcast; `batchLocalBroadcast.ts` owns sequential nonce order
    and tail halting; `singleOutcome.ts` and `batchLocalReceipts.ts` own durable
    ambiguous/pending recovery; and `receiptFinalizer.ts` owns the rule that an
    unobserved ambiguous hash is not proof of a dropped transaction. Stable
    `single.ts`, `batch.ts`, and `receiptPoller.ts` paths are export-only
    facades, so callers cannot bypass those focused implementations.

    Arbitrum uses the same reviewed local-account boundary but signs the exact
    child transaction before submitting `0x04 || signedTransaction` to the L1
    Inbox. Only the child hash and public Bridge delivery preimage are persisted;
    raw signed child bytes are not stored. The later trusted-UI-only force action
    runs behind the internal irreversible-operation/reset barrier, rechecks the
    local account immediately before broadcast, re-reads sequencer consumption
    and the strict on-chain deadline, and matches the saved preimage against the
    canonical L1 receipt before signing `SequencerInbox.forceInclusion`.

14c. **Remote signer responses are bounded and proven** - Bankr sign, submit,
    and job responses have deadlines and streamed byte limits. User-facing
    remote error text is control-character stripped and capped at 1,000
    characters. Personal-sign and typed-data signatures are locally recovered;
    submit responses must carry the reviewed signer, chain, and a valid hash.
    The effect guard becomes ambiguous only immediately before the irreversible
    submit fetch. Abort/timeouts or unprovable post-submit responses retain the
    lease and surface an outcome-unknown warning rather than a safe-to-retry
    cancellation message; HTTP 408/409/425/429 and 5xx are classified the same
    way. Bankr requests
    reject redirects to keep `X-API-Key` on the fixed API origin. Chat prompt
    submission also caps the prompt/body and validates its job ID. Sponsored-
    transfer relayer/premium responses use the same bounded-read and strict-
    schema rules.

14d. **Sponsored ERC-3009 ambiguity never creates a second spend** - Before
    the relay request starts, the exact nonce/signature payload is encrypted
    with the general vault key and committed to bounded
    `sponsoredTransferIntents` storage. An ambiguous timeout/disconnect retains
    that record without re-POSTing, signing another authorization, or exposing
    the normal gas-paid fallback. Status resolution requires two fixed Base
    RPCs to agree on USDC `authorizationState` at their exact finalized blocks;
    local wall time, RPC disagreement, and malformed storage all fail closed.
    Submitted/consumed results remain semantic dedupe markers until the trusted
    renderer acknowledges their stored intent ID. Account removal and reset
    share the sponsored-operation boundary and are blocked while any such
    record remains.

15. **RPC proxy restricts URL sources and methods** - `handleSafeRpcRequest` only accepts extension-configured RPC URLs and an explicit public read/simulation method allowlist. Signing, transaction/raw submission, debug/admin, and stateful filter-lifecycle methods are rejected in both the provider and service worker. A 15-second timeout limits slow endpoints. The inpage dapp-RPC fast path remains narrower: it only uses HTTP(S) JSON-RPC URLs discovered from the page itself, validates the chain with `eth_chainId`, forwards allowlisted non-critical reads, and falls back to the extension RPC on error or timeout.

16. **Injected signing intake requires a connected origin** - Before `sendTransaction` or `signatureRequest` creates pending state, `dapp/requestPolicy.ts` requires a top-level content-script sender, verifies that the sender frame still matches the current tab origin, canonicalizes the Chrome-attested origin, and checks an exact `dappPermissions` grant. Page-provided origins never authorize a request; failures return code `4100` through `txResult:*` / `sigResult:*`.

17. **Input length validation on user-facing strings** - Display names and group names are capped at 100 characters to prevent storage bloat from malformed inputs. Unknown message types are logged with `console.warn` for debuggability.

18. **Non-critical caches are fail-open** - Metadata/image caches (`tokenInfo:*`, `tokenLogo:*`, `ethShLabels:*`, `swapTokenList:*`, `cs:desc:*`, CoinGecko caches, `portfolioHoldingsCache`, `historyNftMetadataCache`, and `ensAvatarImageCache`) must never block wallet-critical storage writes. Cache writes are best-effort and bounded/expired entries are pruned by their owning cache or `storage/cachePruner.ts` through the stable root facade.

## Pre-Commit Security Checklist

When reviewing or making changes to extension code, verify the following:

### If you added/modified a background message route:

- [ ] Does the handler touch secrets (API keys, passwords, private keys, vault keys)?
- [ ] If it modifies secrets or accounts, does it check `getPasswordType() === "agent"` and block?
- [ ] Does the handler return secrets in the response? If so, is `isTrustedWalletUiSender(sender)` checked to prevent content scripts and web-accessible extension pages from requesting secrets?
- [ ] Could a compromised content script abuse this handler? Consider what happens if arbitrary messages are sent from a web page context.

### If you modified crypto, encryption, or storage:

- [ ] Are new salt and IV generated for each encryption operation?
- [ ] Is PBKDF2 iteration count still 600,000?
- [ ] Did you update BOTH read AND write paths for any changed storage keys? (Common bug: updating reads but forgetting writes in other handlers)
- [ ] Grep for the storage key name across all files to find every touchpoint.
- [ ] Do persisted crypto codecs reject unknown versions, malformed field
      shapes, oversized records, and ambiguous IDs before any write/migration?

### If you modified content scripts or inpage scripts:

- [ ] Does `inject.ts` still only forward the whitelisted message types?
- [ ] Are any new messages being sent from background to content scripts? Do they contain sensitive data?
- [ ] Is `e.source === window` still checked before forwarding messages?

### If you modified session/cache logic:

- [ ] Is auto-lock still enforced (cache expiry checked in getters)?
- [ ] Does opening/reopening popup or sidepanel after timeout keep the wallet locked instead of reviving expired caches?
- [ ] Does the `suspend` event still clear all caches?
- [ ] Does manual lock (`lockWallet`) still clear all caches and restorable session storage?
- [ ] Does manual lock acquire the wallet-secret operation lock before clearing cached vault/mnemonic keys?
- [ ] Does manual lock attempt the local recovery key first and the session half independently, accepting either confirmed deletion but showing a blocking retry state if neither succeeds?
- [ ] On simultaneous recovery-half failure, do all open wallet surfaces purge renderer auth state, suppress passkey auto-prompting, and receive the retry state while the worker blocks routine restoration?
- [ ] Does unified password/passkey restore require an authenticated exact
      timeout, current factor binding, and either same-surface continuity or a
      non-expired inactivity deadline?
- [ ] Can a newly opened renderer ID ever revive a record whose last
      authenticated heartbeat/idle deadline has expired? It must not.
- [ ] Does a coherent live passkey session make restoration a no-op that
      preserves its auth epoch and V2 mnemonic key?
- [ ] Does factor removal revoke the local restorable-session recovery half before
      its factor commit, preserving the factor if revocation fails?
- [ ] Do capability-only/view-only sessions require both an expiry-checked
      vault key and password type rather than accepting either partial alone?

### If you added a message handler that uses cached authorization capabilities:

- [ ] Does the handler call the central restoration primitive only when the
      coherent wallet capability generation is absent, leaving unified
      factor/lease/timeout policy inside that primitive?
- [ ] Does it avoid treating a null cached password as a lock signal? Fresh
      passkey sessions intentionally have no plaintext password.
- [ ] Does it re-read the operation-specific capability after a necessary cold
      restore and capture any auth epoch only after restoration completes?
- [ ] Are fresh-passkey, cold-worker finite, exact-expiry, and Never paths
      covered by tests?
- [ ] Is the handler added to the "Handlers with Session Restoration" table in IMPLEMENTATION.md?
- [ ] Without restoration, a cold handler fails after worker restart; with a
      redundant live restore, it can discard mnemonic authority or invalidate
      an in-flight master authorization.

### If you added new storage keys:

- [ ] Is sensitive data encrypted before storage?
- [ ] Is the key documented in the Storage Keys Reference above?
- [ ] Is `chrome.storage.sync` only used for non-sensitive data?
- [ ] Is the key included in the exact wallet-reset manifest when it belongs to
      the wallet identity?
- [ ] For an IndexedDB database/store change, is its version/schema documented,
      is the upgrade additive or migrated safely, and does wallet reset delete
      it explicitly outside the `chrome.storage` manifest?

### If you modified Ledger support:

- [ ] Does WebHID permission still originate from an explicit trusted-UI user gesture?
- [ ] Does the offscreen document receive no password, vault key, private key, seed phrase, or API key?
- [ ] Does the offscreen listener authorize the exact extension service-worker sender before dispatch?
- [ ] Is the connected device re-bound through the canonical public identity before every scan/sign?
- [ ] Is the recovered transaction/message/EIP-712 signer checked against the pinned account?
- [ ] Do account mutations remain master-only while agent sessions can sign but cannot reveal/add/remove?
- [ ] Does first-account onboarding defer Ledger persistence until after master credential initialization and retain the rollback marker through the write?
- [ ] Do Firefox builds omit the `offscreen` permission and offscreen JavaScript target?
- [ ] Were normal Bankr, private-key, seed-phrase, and view-only paths regression-tested?

### General checks:

- [ ] New service-worker logic lives in its owning `src/chrome/<domain>/`
      folder, not as another flat root-prefixed file. Any root exception is an
      entrypoint, policy-free compatibility facade, or documented shared primitive.
- [ ] The domain `README.md`, `_docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md`, and mirrored
      `tests/<domain>/README.md` still describe the actual ownership and effect flow.
- [ ] New or modified implementation files remain below the ~400-line audit
      ceiling; transitional composition-root size budgets did not increase.
- [ ] Compatibility facades preserve exact exports and contain no storage,
      authorization, cryptography, network effects, or business policy.
- [ ] Architecture tests cover forbidden dependency direction, facade identity,
      and size budgets for newly extracted modules.
- [ ] No `console.log` of sensitive data (passwords, keys, secrets)
- [ ] No `eval()`, `new Function()`, or dynamic code execution
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets, API keys, or credentials
- [ ] Build passes: `pnpm build:extension`

  with full replacement storage, preventing live Safe proxy or other contract

### Safe multisig boundaries

1. **Contract authority, not address equivalence.** Import and every
   irreversible Safe action verify a pinned canonical proxy runtime/singleton,
   supported Safe version, owners, threshold, nonce, modules, guard, fallback
   handler, and owner code at an exact block. The configuration epoch binds
   review to effect. Unknown deployments/extensions, contract or nested
   owners, arbitrary delegatecall, and unknown confirmation types fail closed.
   The bundled deployment projection contains only network aliases, released
   addresses, and code hashes from the pinned official Safe Deployments
   package; a deterministic parity test prevents generated metadata drift.
   Supported Safe transaction hashes are rebuilt from the exact chain-bound
   SafeTx EIP-712 schema rather than a broad runtime SDK barrel.

2. **No account-type fallthrough.** A Safe row cannot enter an EOA, Bankr,
   delegated-permission, sponsored, swap, bridge, force-inclusion, or message-
   signature path through a default branch. Unsupported Safe features are
   centrally denied, and staged rollout can disable each effect tier.
   Injected connection approval grants only address visibility for an imported
   Safe. Cached owner capability and connection-network deployment do not gate
   that visibility, matching ordinary account switching. The imported-record
   and injected-feature checks remain in the background; exact-chain onchain
   verification, live owner eligibility, quorum, and session authorization remain
   mandatory at proposal/signing/execution boundaries. Connecting never promotes
   an observe-only or blocked Safe to a signer. WalletConnect's negotiated
   chain/method eligibility remains separate and unchanged.

3. **Service data is coordination only.** Safe reads and writes go directly to
   Safe's official gateway; there is no WalletChan backend route or server
   credential. The bounded Config Service registry accepts transaction targets
   only under `https://api.safe.global/tx-service/*`, rejects redirects,
   duplicate/malformed chain IDs, unsafe public RPC fallbacks, and non-EVM
   networks, and is cached only in service-worker memory. Hidden and custom
   WalletChan chains are matched only by numeric chain ID. The extension
   reconstructs every transaction, recomputes `safeTxHash`, recovers each EOA
   confirmation, binds it to a distinct current owner, and excludes unsupported
   types from quorum. A service refresh may add validated confirmations or an
   execution hash, but it cannot downgrade a locally claimed/prepared/broadcast
   effect, discard an unpublished local confirmation, or erase deterministic
   outer transaction evidence. Terminal execution still passes through receipt
   reconciliation so provider/ERC-5792 results and same-nonce competitors are
   settled exactly once.

4. **Owner discovery is one-address opt-in.** The trusted UI sends one selected
   local account ID. The background resolves it afresh and accepts only a
   Bankr/private-key/seed/Ledger record before disclosing that one address to Safe.
   It never batches all wallet addresses. Progressive discovery batches the
   intersection of visible WalletChan networks and Safe's live registry, not
   owners: hidden chains cause no owner disclosure, and each bounded page
   re-resolves the same selected account ID and returns verified results
   incrementally. The initial count-only page performs no Safe owner request;
   it only computes the visible Safe-supported total. Manual Safe-address
   probing is separate and does not disclose owner accounts.

   Foreground proposal refresh is also exact-account and exact-chain scoped.
   The trusted UI supplies one Safe account ID and the proposal's chain ID; the
   background resolves both against the stored Safe record, then directly
   re-verifies that address through the configured RPC. It does not repeat
   Transaction Service discovery, broaden owner discovery, or disclose a local
   owner address. Safe security may omit the chain ID to re-verify every
   previously imported snapshot while concurrently checking only missing
   visible Safe-supported networks through the Transaction Service. Newly
   found addresses still require exact onchain verification before their
   chain-keyed snapshot is merged; discovery errors cannot downgrade or fail
   successful known-chain RPC verification. The connected-dapp dock treats
   this verified snapshot map as presentation eligibility: all visible chains
   remain listed, while unverified chain IDs are disabled rather than being
   offered as a provider switch.

5. **One pinned owner per authorization.** Each approval chooses one current
   Bankr/private-key/seed/Ledger record and repeats live authority checks
   immediately before releasing its signature. Ledger uses the central
   device/path-bound SafeTx EIP-712 signer and repeats that public metadata
   binding after hardware approval. Impersonator and Safe records cannot sign.
   Account-type eligibility is defined only by the exhaustive
   `safe/accountTypePolicy.ts` matrix; discovery, stored confirmation decoding,
   authorization, execution, and renderer filtering must use its guards rather
   than maintain independent allowlists.
   Agent passwords may approve ordinary proposals but cannot reveal PK/seed
   secrets or make future authority changes. The confirmation renderer does
   not collect another password: Bankr credentials and local keys are resolved
   only from the live expiry-checked cache or the same bounded native-session
   restoration used by ordinary transaction/signature confirmation. A missing
   capability fails closed as locked. The auth epoch is captured only after
   restoration and is rechecked after asynchronous signing and immediately
   before outer execution broadcast.

6. **Ambiguity is durable.** First-action claims own approval, publication,
   and execution effects. Periodic Safe sync and direct Transaction Service
   reconciliation preserve a claim that is still owned by a live worker
   operation, including a long Ledger device prompt. The in-memory active-claim
   registry is intentionally empty after worker restart, so startup recovery
   can immediately repair every durable interrupted claim. A completed owner
   approval merges into the current locked confirmation set rather than
   replacing approvals that arrived while hardware signing was pending. Exact
   signed outer execution bytes and their
   deterministic hash are persisted before native broadcast. Token-funded
   execution instead persists the deterministic EntryPoint UserOperation hash
   before Pimlico broadcast; no UserOperation signature, authorization, quote,
   paymaster data, or calldata is stored. Lost RPC responses are
   reconciled immediately by a bounded poller and resumed by a dedicated
   30-second MV3 alarm plus startup recovery. Read-only reconciliation tries
   the configured RPC before pinned built-in/canonical endpoints. It
   distinguishes a valid null receipt from transport/RPC failure; only the
   former is evidence that a healthy endpoint has not indexed the transaction.
   Receipt and Safe nonce are authoritative, and only identical signed bytes
   may be resent. Any durable execute claim, transaction/UserOperation hash, or serialized envelope
   rejects a second prepare/send path even when display state is stale. Reset
   and Safe removal fail while effects are unresolved. `safeTxHash` is proposal
   identity only and is never returned as an onchain transaction result.
   On service-worker startup, an interrupted approval claim may return to its
   prior retryable local state because no signature was published; an
   interrupted publication is always made ambiguous, and execution becomes
   retryable only when neither a deterministic hash nor serialized bytes were
   persisted. Otherwise exact-envelope reconciliation remains mandatory.

7. **Executor selection is explicit and bounded.** The UI defaults outer
   execution to a WalletChan-controlled private-key/seed/Ledger owner when one
   is available, but may select another local private-key/seed/Ledger account
   to pay native gas. Bankr, impersonator, and Safe records never fall through
   to the local outer signer. Ledger execution reuses the central
   device/path-bound transaction signer, reserves the exact EOA nonce, and
   persists the same deterministic signed envelope before broadcast. The
   background resolves the selected account ID afresh, validates
   the shared gas override quantities, rechecks live quorum/configuration, and
   simulates the exact immutable `execTransaction` envelope immediately before
   the serialized transaction crosses the RPC boundary. If that simulation
   reverts, execution remains blocked by default. The trusted WalletChan UI may
   retry only after the user accepts the shared likely-to-fail warning; the
   background recognizes only literal boolean `true` and still performs every
   account, auth-epoch, quorum, nonce, configuration, fee, serialization, and
   duplicate-submit check before broadcast.
   At quorum, eligible private-key/seed executors may select an address-pinned
   catalog ERC-20 through the shared fee selector. Option discovery and quote
   preparation use that exact executor on the Safe's chain. Confirmation
   consumes the single-use quote only for the same proposal, executor account,
   address, and outer call, then repeats live Safe quorum/configuration,
   auth-epoch, delegation, nonce, allowance, balance, and exact-envelope
   simulation checks. Bankr, Ledger, impersonator, and Safe records do not enter
   this Safe fee-payment path.
   Every Safe proposal explicitly uses the trusted-UI-only Safe simulation
   route, including unsigned proposals that do not yet have an outer execution
   request. Its asset-delta pass discovers candidates by tracing the reviewed
   underlying calls directly and by bounded calldata extraction; it never
   accepts a Safe proxy's non-empty access list for an unsupported ERC-7821
   `execute` selector as evidence that call assets were visited. Once quorum
   exists, review-time simulation treats the exact signed outer envelope as
   the revert authority. The separate Safe-address bytecode pass may contribute
   asset deltas, but cannot override that verdict because installing simulator
   code at the Safe necessarily replaces the proxy runtime and makes Safe
   self-calls unrepresentative. The composite route is read-only and carries
   no credential or signing capability.
   EOA residual-approval cleanup also supports Bankr on Bankr-supported
   chains through the existing atomic executor. Single-request conversion
   retains the original Bankr credential tag, and generated revokes share
   their parent source authorization without an independent dapp result.
   Account/chain validation, opaque evidence checks, request claims, and
   exact-call fee-quote binding remain mandatory for every mutation.
   Residual-approval cleanup is a separate trusted-UI mutation. It is allowed
   only for a zero-signature editable proposal. The route accepts only opaque
   token/spender evidence bound to the exact proposal fingerprint; it never
   accepts renderer-authored cleanup calldata or addresses. The background
   re-verifies the stored Safe account, chain support, live
   singleton/version/configuration, proposal identity, and call limit, then
   rebuilds the same nonce and route with final zero-value Safe CALLs carrying
   canonical `approve(spender, 0)` calldata. Signed, claimed, executing,
   rejection, stale-evidence, or otherwise immutable proposals fail closed;
   renderer policy cannot bypass these checks.

8. **Signed rejection is onchain only.** Local cancellation rejects only a
   proposal with zero supported and zero unsupported collected confirmations.
   Once any signature exists, the trusted-UI-only
   `startSafeProposalRejection` route verifies the live configuration and exact
   executable nonce, then constructs only the canonical zero-value, empty-data
   Safe self-call at that nonce. It reuses the ordinary per-owner signature,
   publication, threshold, executor, auth-epoch, simulation, and ambiguity
   gates. The original proposal is not marked cancelled and provider/ERC-5792
   outcomes are not failed until the rejection execution receipt confirms.
   Pending signed proposals cannot be hidden as a substitute for rejection.

9. **Nonce allocation is fresh and atomic; replacement is explicit.** Ordinary
   wallet, provider, WalletConnect, ERC-5792, and Safe-swap intake first reads
   verified onchain Safe state, then allocates the lowest unreserved nonce under
   the same storage lock that persists the proposal.
   Unresolved local and service-verified requests reserve nonces; terminal and
   hidden records do not. The trusted-UI-only `changeSafeProposalNonce` route
   accepts a canonical bounded decimal string, re-verifies the Safe directly
   onchain, rejects values below the live nonce, and atomically replaces only a
   zero-signature draft/future request. Calls, Safe/account/chain identity,
   configuration epoch, creation time, and provider route remain immutable.
   Existing signatures, unsupported confirmations, effect claims, execution
   hashes, signed bytes, and canonical rejection proposals all fail closed.
   Choosing an occupied nonce is therefore possible only through the explicit
   Advanced details pencil action; automatic allocation never selects one.
   A future nonce is not an approval-authority boundary: owner authorization
   accepts a freshly verified live nonce less than or equal to the reviewed
   proposal nonce, so queued requests may collect and publish signatures. It
   still rejects if the live nonce has advanced past the proposal. Estimation
   and execution retain the stricter equality check immediately before signing
   and again before broadcast, so no queued Safe transaction can execute out
   of order. When a queued nonce becomes current, reconciliation recomputes
   readiness only from already validated durable confirmations and the freshly
   verified threshold; it rechecks effect/execution claims under the proposal
   storage lock so it cannot overwrite an approval or broadcast in flight.
   The sole terminal-record reuse is an atomic reactivation of the same
   `safeTxHash` after a zero-signature local cancellation that has no purpose,
   onchain-rejection link, effect claim, execution hash, or serialized bytes.
   It replaces the already-rejected route with the freshly reviewed request
   route. Signed, published, prepared, broadcast, failed, replaced, and
   onchain-rejected identities are never reset through this path.

## Known Accepted Risks

These are security characteristics that have been reviewed and accepted:

1. **Native "Never" sessions retain a recoverable encrypted credential.** A
   password unlock retains the encrypted password; a passkey unlock retains
   only the encrypted 32-byte general vault capability, bound to the current
   passkey factor and master authority. Neither passkey PRF output nor the
   mnemonic key is retained. The ciphertext is in memory-backed
   `chrome.storage.session` and its random AES key is in local extension
   storage. This survives MV3 service-worker suspension but not browser
   closure because the ciphertext half disappears. Browsers without native
   session storage do not persist either recovery half. If the live extension
   service-worker context is compromised, its decrypted API/private-key
   session state is already exposed.

2. **No rate limiting on local unlock attempts.** PBKDF2-SHA256 with 600,000
   iterations slows each guess but does not make a weak password safe against
   an attacker who copies the encrypted profile and guesses offline. New
   passwords require 8 to 256 characters and reject the common-password
   denylist; existing shorter legacy passwords remain accepted for unlock so
   an upgrade cannot strand users. Users with legacy weak passwords should
   rotate them.

3. **`getCachedApiKey` returns plaintext API key** to the extension UI. This is necessary for displaying it in settings and for the UI to function. The UI is same-origin with the background worker.

4. **Content script runs on all websites**. Required for wallet provider injection. The content script only bridges specific message types and does not expose any secrets.

5. **RPC proxy in background (`rpcRequest` handler)** accepts allowlisted public
   read/simulation methods against extension-configured RPC URLs. This bypasses
   page CSP for legitimate reads. The boundary rejects redirects and
   literal/reserved private-network targets according to caller origin, and
   enforces request/response/concurrency/15-second limits. Loopback requires a
   loopback caller and LAN targets require the caller's exact hostname unless
   the exact active endpoint carries the trusted Settings-only impersonated-
   transaction opt-in. That explicit exception retains the read/simulation
   allowlist and does not expose submission, signing, debug/admin, or filters.
   The background worker explicitly omits credentials and referrers.

6. **Console logging of migration events and decryption operations** in `auth/legacyVaultKeyMigration.ts`, `auth/sessionHydration.ts`, and `session/restoration.ts`. Logs include timing information ("API key migration completed", "Private key migration completed", "Session restored after service worker restart") but never log the actual secrets (keys, passwords). Acceptable because: (a) Chrome DevTools requires explicit user action to open, (b) logs provide critical debugging information for migration and session restore flows, and (c) no secrets are exposed in log messages.

7. **Private-network classification is hostname-based.** Browser `fetch()` does
   not expose the selected socket address, so the service worker can reject
   literal/reserved IPv4/IPv6 hostnames and redirects but cannot independently
   pin DNS resolution against rebinding. Remote images require HTTPS, omit
   credentials/referrers, accept only bounded raster responses, and never
   expose raw response text. RPC forwarding accepts only a URL already present
   in extension-owned network configuration; users should not add untrusted
   custom RPC hosts.

8. **Pre-hardening public-HTTP RPC entries remain readable.** New public RPC
   additions and edits require HTTPS, but an already-synced HTTP endpoint is
   not silently deleted or disabled during upgrade. This preserves existing
   custom-chain access; its transport remains redirect/credential/size/time/
   concurrency bounded, but HTTP cannot provide server authenticity or traffic
   confidentiality. Editing that chain requires replacing the endpoint with
   HTTPS. Local/private development RPCs may continue using HTTP explicitly.

### Injected chain visibility and connection-first switching

Unconnected injected pages receive Ethereum mainnet as public chain state, not
saved UI chain context. Runtime chain updates require connected account access;
revocation resets public chain state and invalidates pending
switch continuations. `wallet_switchEthereumChain` validates its target before
using the existing exact-origin/top-frame connection approval. After approval it
rechecks target metadata, Bankr support, and connected-origin account visibility.
An imported Safe requires a stored Safe record for visibility, not deployment or
approval capability on that chain. Safe transaction/proposal operations separately
enforce exact-chain deployment and authority. View-only connections never
authorize signing.
Switch results are request-ID correlated and duplicate switches are rejected.
No new message type, permission grant mechanism, secret, or storage key is added.
Add-chain retains its existing connection and network-approval requirements.

Same-origin embedded dapp compatibility reuses the exact top-page provider in
`provider/inpage/sameOriginFrame.ts`. Access to `top.location.origin` must pass
browser same-origin enforcement and match a non-opaque child origin before any
listener is installed. Requests use the top object's bound methods; direct
iframe connection/signing requests retain the existing rejection gates. No
cross-origin forwarding, origin override, or background permission exception is
introduced. The child result router is not installed, so child init/account
messages cannot mutate the top provider state.

### WNS browsing boundary

Exact `.wei` / `*.wei.limo` / `*.wei.domains` browsing uses the existing
Ethereum RPC transport and pinned WNS registry, independently of ENS. Only
IPFS/IPNS contenthashes or the resolved contract's nonempty, at-most-1-MiB
`html()` output are accepted. HTML is never evaluated in an extension page;
it is served by the hosted gateway or pinned through the existing Kubo
onchain-content cache. The new gateway allowlist retains exact suffix,
matching top-level origin, and message-audience checks. No new secret storage
or signing capability is introduced. DNR interception applies only to main
frames, is disabled with local routing, and installs a tab-bound hosted
fallback bypass to prevent loops.

### GNS contract-hosted websites

GNS contenthash takes precedence over an explicit `contentcontract` text
record. Only a bare/mainnet `eth:` or Sepolia `sep:` 20-byte nonzero address
is accepted; arbitrary URLs, paths, and other chains are rejected. No
resolved-owner fallback is used. Local snapshots use the configured content
chain RPC and bounded onchain HTML pinning; `5219` and raw-calldata `manual`
modes remain distinct. Local content must be nonempty HTML of at most 1 MiB;
non-200, encoded, and chunked responses are rejected. Hosted links preserve
the GNS origin and existing per-tab bypass. No signing or secret access is
introduced.


### ENS multichain identity boundary

Forward recipient resolution requests the selected network's ENSIP-11 coin type
through Ethereum L1. Missing/malformed records and RPC failures never authorize
an Ethereum-address fallback. ENSIP-19 default handling belongs to the resolver.
Reverse names and service fallback candidates must forward-match the actual
address on that network before display. Network changes invalidate both pending
Send lookups and displayed identity state; cache entries are network-qualified.
Chain IDs outside the 31-bit ENSIP-11 range are not truncated.
History `ClearSignedMeta.counterpartyEnsChainId` binds newly verified name
snapshots to the transaction network. Unqualified legacy snapshots remain
readable but cannot supply a verified ENS label. These changes add no secret
storage, message audience, signing capability, or submission path.

Network-independent account management retains verified Ethereum mainnet profiles
for compatibility with existing ENS primary names. This is the no-network API
default only: Send and transaction surfaces always pass their network explicitly.
Explicit chain 0 still requests the default EVM record, and its cached misses
cannot suppress an account profile cached under chain 1.

Known wallet accounts and saved contacts use their established mainnet profile
for display across all networks, including transaction detail pills and signing
account rows. The shared renderer identity hook partitions profile lookups from
unknown-address network lookups and keeps their caches separate. A known profile
is an address-book identity, not proof of that name's payment destination on the
transaction network. Forward name-to-recipient resolution remains chain-specific.

### Safe review warning scope

External exact-schema SafeTx signatures and imported proposals use the shared
presentation-only transactionRisk analysis. Warning suppression never trusts the
registry's global MultiSend fallback: it requires exact network aliases, a matching
signed/request chain domain, canonical complete ABI encoding, and bounded CALL-only
batch contents. Every inner delegatecall (including another MultiSend) retains the
warning. Missing or ambiguous deployment/domain information cannot grant an exemption.
These warnings do not authorize requests or replace existing background validation,
owner/session binding, hash verification, or all-four-signer final release checks.

Nonzero signed gasPrice is disclosed independent of simulation and lifecycle, including
refund-bearing rejection proposals. Imported refund fields are never rewritten. Zero
refundReceiver is the eventual transaction submitter; no estimate or threat verdict
is inferred. No new storage keys or message routes exist. A UI acknowledgement
binds to exact reviewed data and actor/action; it is not a background
authorization capability.

## Legacy ERC-20 address padding regression (2026-09-08)

The known-selector calldata guard includes `increaseApproval` (`0xd73dd623`)
and `decreaseApproval` (`0x66188463`). Shared injected/WalletConnect single and
batch ingress rejects non-canonical known calls before signer dispatch, in
addition to the existing review UI checks. This applies independently of account
or password type. It does not recursively validate arbitrary wrapper calldata
or make unknown selectors safe. Contract creation is exempt from ABI-call
interpretation. No new secrets, permissions, storage keys, or signing transports.
See [local evidence and manual QA](./LEGACY_APPROVAL_PADDING.md).
