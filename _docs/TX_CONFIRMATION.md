# Transaction Confirmation Surfaces

**ALL transaction confirmation screens must offer the same gas-fee UX.** The wallet has multiple confirmation surfaces and they must stay in lockstep — when one ships a new gas feature, the others have to ship it too, or users get inconsistent behavior depending on how they triggered the tx.

## Confirmation surfaces today

| Surface | File | Underlying gas component |
|---|---|---|
| Single-tx confirmation (dapp-initiated) | `apps/extension/src/components/TransactionConfirmation.tsx` | `GasEstimateDisplay.tsx` |
| Batch tx confirmation (ERC-5792, dapp-initiated) | `apps/extension/src/components/BatchTransactionConfirmation.tsx` | `MultiTxGasEstimateDisplay.tsx` |
| Cross-dapp batch confirmation (user-assembled) | `apps/extension/src/components/CrossDappBatchConfirmation.tsx` | `MultiTxGasEstimateDisplay.tsx` (wraps BatchTransactionConfirmation) |
| **Swap / Bridge confirmation (internal)** | `apps/extension/src/components/Swap/SwapConfirmation.tsx` | `MultiTxGasEstimateDisplay.tsx` |
| **Safe approval / execution** | `apps/extension/src/components/SafeApprovals/SafeProposalConfirmation.tsx` | `GasEstimateDisplay.tsx` (execution and final-owner Sign & Execute) |

**When you change anything about gas params, the tier picker, validity, or override plumbing in ANY of these screens, audit the others.** The swap path in particular is easy to miss — it's its own confirmation UI separate from the dapp-initiated batch flow but uses the same underlying `MultiTxGasEstimateDisplay`.

**Cross-chain bridges ride inside the same `SwapConfirmation.tsx`** via the optional `bridgeMeta` prop (no new surface). When set, the title flips to "Confirm Bridge", the network row shows source → destination chains, and a Bungee route / ETA row appears. Gas plumbing is unchanged. After the source-tx confirms, `bridgeStatusPoller` watches `/api/bridge/status` and fires a destination notification — see [`BRIDGE.md`](./BRIDGE.md) "Extension support".

## Required wiring (PK / Seed accounts)

For any tx-confirmation surface:

1. Pass `isNonAtomic={true}` to `MultiTxGasEstimateDisplay` (or use `GasEstimateDisplay` for single tx) so the tier picker actually renders.
2. Wire `onGasEstimates` (or `onGasOverrides` for single tx) to a parent state.
3. Wire `onValidityChange` to a `gasValid` state and disable the Confirm button on `!gasValid`.
4. Send the gas estimates / overrides through to the background handler that signs the tx.
5. Make sure the background handler actually applies them at sign time (clears legacy `gasPrice`, sets `maxFeePerGas` / `maxPriorityFeePerGas` / `gas` from the override).

**Bankr / impersonator paths are exempt:** Bankr handles gas server-side; impersonator can't broadcast. The gas component handles these gracefully (picker auto-hides), but the parent should still set `isNonAtomic` correctly so the picker only fires its callbacks for PK / Seed.

## Atomic-7702 wiring (PK / Seed batch surfaces)

When a PK/SP batch resolves to `strategy === "atomic-7702"` (the dapp-batch screens flip `isNonAtomic` to `false`), `MultiTxGasEstimateDisplay` switches to "wrapped batch" mode and needs one extra prop:

- `eip7702Delegate={batchPlan.delegate}` **only when `batchPlan.needsAuthorization === true`** — triggers a state-override path in `estimateGas` that injects the delegate's runtime code at the EOA so the simulation matches post-auth chain state. When `needsAuthorization === false` the EOA is already onchain-delegated; pass `undefined` so we use plain `estimateGas` (more RPC-robust on Base public RPC and similar tiers where `stateOverride` support on `eth_estimateGas` lags behind `eth_call`).

The component additionally fires `estimateBatchGasSequential` over the inner calls in parallel as a fallback for any PK/SP batchedTx surface — handles `eth_estimateGas` binary-search divergence on deeply nested executor calldata (1inch v6 with executor, V4-with-hooks) so the "may revert" banner doesn't false-fire on batches that land cleanly. See [`7702.md` → Gas estimation](./7702.md#gas-estimation).

## Adding a NEW tx-confirmation surface

List it in the table above and make sure every gas feature here works on it before merging.

## Final-owner Safe combined action

The final unsigned native executor may choose Sign & Execute or keep Sign offchain.
The complete asset simulation waits for authority and execution-envelope
preparation, avoiding an initial approximation followed by a second pass.
The combined button keeps its dots until simulation and fee loading finish;
transport/preparation errors stop loading and retain the offchain choice.
The same GasEstimateDisplay tier, balance validity, and gas overrides are reviewed
before combined confirmation. Preparation estimates a read-only owner-sender
preview with headroom; after obtaining the real owner signature, the background
estimates the exact envelope again and refuses execution above the reviewed limit.
It passes those exact native overrides through normal Safe execution. This does
not change gas behavior on single, batch, cross-dapp, or swap/bridge surfaces.
