# Publishing & Distribution

WalletChan is distributed through two channels.

## Distribution Channels

|                      | GitHub Releases (sideloading)                                          | Chrome Web Store                                                                                          |

### Two Zip Variants

CWS **rejects** uploads containing a `key` field in `manifest.json` (it assigns its own extension ID). The shipped `manifest.json` does not include `key`, so `pnpm zip` and `pnpm zip:cws` produce equivalent output today; the strip step in `scripts/strip-cws-keys.sh` is kept as a safety net in case `key` is ever re-introduced.

Both `zip` and `zip:cws` run `pnpm build` automatically — no need to build separately first.

### Extension license and corresponding source

WalletChan browser-extension releases beginning with v4.0.0 are
GPL-3.0-only. The repository's other components remain under their own
licenses. Every Chrome and Firefox build automatically contains:

- `LICENSE.txt`: the complete GNU GPL version 3 text;
- `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt`: the exact `snarkjs@0.7.5` attribution and source;
- `SOURCE_CODE.txt`: the matching WalletChan release tag, build instructions,
  and exact `snarkjs` source location.

The GPL/`snarkjs` distribution decision is complete. Release packaging requires
the extension to be at least v4.0.0 and its matching `vX.Y.Z` source tag to be
public before distribution.

Releases through v3.19.0 keep the license that accompanied those copies; the v4
license does not revoke earlier grants.

## Release Process

### 1. Bump version and push tag

```bash
pnpm release:patch  # 0.2.0 → 0.2.1 (bug fixes)
pnpm release:minor  # 0.2.0 → 0.3.0 (new features)
pnpm release:major  # 0.2.0 → 1.0.0 (breaking changes)
```

**Important:** The working tree must be clean before running a release command,
including no untracked files. `scripts/release.sh` checks
`git status --porcelain` so an untracked source or asset cannot affect a local
build while being omitted from the release commit.

**Store artifact rule:** Every extension version bump must be followed by a fresh `pnpm zip:cws` run before uploading to stores. Do not reuse an older zip after changing `apps/extension/package.json` or either manifest version. This regenerates `apps/extension/cws-zip/walletchan-vX.Y.Z.zip` for Chrome Web Store and `apps/extension/zip/walletchan-firefox-vX.Y.Z.zip` for Firefox.

This automatically (via `scripts/release.sh`):

1. Bumps the version in `apps/extension/package.json`
2. Syncs the version to `apps/extension/public/manifest.json` and `apps/extension/manifest.firefox.json`
3. Promotes the populated `[Unreleased]` changelog into the new version
4. Commits the release files from the repo root (so monorepo paths resolve correctly)
5. Creates a git tag (e.g. `v0.2.1`)
6. Pushes to origin with tags

### 2. GitHub Actions builds the release

The [release workflow](/.github/workflows/release.yml) triggers on `v*` tags and:

1. Runs `pnpm zip` (which builds the extension and creates the zip)
2. Publishes `walletchan-vX.Y.Z.zip` to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/walletchan/walletchan/releases)

Release notes come from the matching version section in the root `CHANGELOG.md`,
with its full-changelog link. `.github/scripts/release-notes.mjs` extracts that
section; the workflow rejects missing/empty entries and tag/version mismatches.
To update an existing release's notes from the changelog:

```bash
node .github/scripts/release-notes.mjs v4.1.0 > /tmp/walletchan-release-notes.md
gh release edit v4.1.0 --repo walletchan/walletchan --notes-file /tmp/walletchan-release-notes.md
```

Users can download the zip from GitHub Releases and load it as an unpacked extension in developer mode.

### 3. Upload to Chrome Web Store

1. Create the fresh store zips for the bumped version (builds automatically):
   ```bash
   pnpm zip:cws
   ```
2. Go to the [CWS Developer Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole)
3. Select the WalletChan extension
4. Upload `apps/extension/cws-zip/walletchan-vX.Y.Z.zip` (not the GitHub Release zip)
5. Fill in any release notes
6. Submit for review

Once approved, **CWS users** receive the update.

### Manual release (optional)

The one-off `Recover v4.1.0 release` workflow builds the original Chrome release
commit `2dda76fd6485d56bc23a8089c13e72e6a6c6bd88` without moving `v4.1.0`.
Its test-only patch corrects three stale Swap labels and records the frozen
snapshot's line counts (executionRoutes 132, pendingRequests 241, settingsRegistry
456). These historical baselines do not relax current development budgets.
The full security suite runs, then the workflow restores the original tests and
requires a clean checkout before building both browser ZIPs. Source, manifests,
dependencies, and build scripts remain those of the original release commit.

If you need to create a release without the automated workflow:

```bash
pnpm zip        # builds + zips with `key` (for GitHub Release)
pnpm zip:cws    # builds + zips without `key` (for CWS upload)
```

Then upload `apps/extension/zip/walletchan-vX.Y.Z.zip` to a new GitHub release.

## NPM Packages: WalletChan RPC and MCP

RPC and MCP releases are maintained in their public repositories:
[WalletChan RPC](https://github.com/walletchan/walletchan-rpc/blob/main/_docs/PUBLISHING.md)
and [WalletChan MCP](https://github.com/walletchan/walletchan-mcp/blob/main/_docs/PUBLISHING.md).
Their npm releases are independent of browser extension releases.

## GitHub Releases (Sideloading)

GitHub Releases provide a ZIP file for users who want to sideload the extension in developer mode. This is useful for beta testing or trying out the extension before it's approved on CWS.

### How to install from GitHub Release

1. Download `walletchan-vX.Y.Z.zip` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/walletchan/walletchan/releases)
2. Extract the zip
3. Go to `chrome://extensions` → enable Developer mode
4. Click "Load unpacked" → select the extracted folder
5. To update: download the new zip, extract, and click the refresh icon on `chrome://extensions`

### Chrome CRX Sideloading Restrictions

Chrome **blocks enabling sideloaded CRX extensions** that aren't from the Chrome Web Store. Dragging a `.crx` file into `chrome://extensions` will install it, but Chrome disables it with the warning: _"This extension is not listed in the Chrome Web Store and may have been added without your knowledge."_

This is why we only distribute ZIP files (for unpacked loading) and not CRX files on GitHub Releases. CRX-based auto-update only works for enterprise/managed installs deployed via group policy (which supplies its own `update_url` via policy, not via the manifest).

### Version Flow

```
pnpm release:patch
  → bumps version in package.json + manifest.json
  → creates git tag v0.2.1
  → pushes to GitHub

GitHub Actions (.github/workflows/release.yml)
  → runs pnpm zip (builds + creates ZIP)
  → attaches to GitHub Release
```

### Update XML Endpoint

The website still serves `update_url` XML at `https://walletchan.com/api/extension/update.xml` for any enterprise installs using the CRX + policy approach. This endpoint fetches the latest GitHub Release version dynamically.

```bash
curl https://walletchan.com/api/extension/update.xml
```

Should return XML with `appid='gmfimlibjdfoeoiohiaipblfklgammci'` and the latest version.

## One-Time Setup (Already Done)

Reference for if signing key or infrastructure needs to be recreated.

### 1. Generate signing key

```bash
openssl genrsa -out walletchan.pem 2048
```

### 2. Get extension ID

Calculate the extension ID from your signing key:

```bash
node -e "
const crypto = require('crypto');
const fs = require('fs');
const pem = fs.readFileSync('walletchan.pem', 'utf8');
const key = crypto.createPrivateKey(pem);
const pubKey = crypto.createPublicKey(key).export({ type: 'spki', format: 'der' });
const hash = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(pubKey).digest();
const id = Array.from(hash.slice(0, 16))
  .map(b => String.fromCharCode((b >> 4) + 97) + String.fromCharCode((b & 0xf) + 97))
  .join('');
console.log(id);
"
```

### 3. Get public key for manifest.json

Extract the public key to set as the `key` field in `manifest.json`:

```bash
node -e "
const crypto = require('crypto');
const fs = require('fs');
const pem = fs.readFileSync('walletchan.pem', 'utf8');
const key = crypto.createPrivateKey(pem);
const pubKey = crypto.createPublicKey(key).export({ type: 'spki', format: 'der' });
console.log(pubKey.toString('base64'));
"
```

### 4. Add GitHub Secrets

In the repository settings, add:

- `EXTENSION_SIGNING_KEY`: Base64 encoded .pem file
  ```bash
  base64 -i walletchan.pem | pbcopy  # macOS
  base64 -w 0 walletchan.pem         # Linux
  ```

### 5. Add website environment variable

Add to your website deployment (Vercel, etc.):

```
EXTENSION_ID=gmfimlibjdfoeoiohiaipblfklgammci
```

This is the **self-hosted** extension ID (from step 2), since only CRX-installed users hit the update endpoint.

### 6. Secure backup

Store the `walletchan.pem` file in a password manager. This key is the extension's identity for self-hosted distribution — losing it means self-hosted users won't receive updates.

## Backward Compatibility & Storage Migrations

Chrome extensions auto-update silently. Users cannot choose to stay on an old version. Every release must work seamlessly for users on **any** previously released version.

> **Full storage key reference:** See [`STORAGE.md`](./STORAGE.md) for every key, its shape, which files touch it, and what each version expects.

### How migrations work

`background/composition/lifecycle.ts` registers `chrome.runtime.onInstalled`
through `background/lifecycle/installUpdate.ts`. On `reason === "update"`, that
lifecycle invokes `accounts/legacyMigration.ts`'s
`migrateFromLegacyStorage()`. As a safety net, `App.tsx` also calls the
`migrateFromLegacy` message handler if it detects no accounts on load. Both
paths share the wallet secret-operation lock and re-read inside it, so
concurrent invocations remain one idempotent migration rather than committing
mismatched account IDs.

### Rules for storage changes

1. **Never remove or rename a storage key without a migration.** If you rename `foo` to `bar`, you must read `foo`, write `bar`, and keep `foo` for at least one release cycle.
2. **Never change the shape of stored data without handling the old shape.** If `accounts` gains a new required field, set a default for entries that lack it.
3. **Migrations must be idempotent.** They can run more than once (onInstalled + App.tsx fallback). Always check if already migrated before writing.
4. **Migrations must not require the wallet to be unlocked.** `onInstalled` fires before the user opens the popup. Only use data from `chrome.storage` (no decryption, no cached passwords).

### Adding a new migration

1. Write an idempotent migration in its owning domain (or in
   `background/lifecycle/installUpdate.ts` only for a small public-settings
   migration). Never add migration logic to the `background.ts` entrypoint:
   ```ts
   async function migrateXxx(): Promise<boolean> {
     // Check if already migrated — exit early
     // Read old format
     // Write new format
     // Return true if migrated, false if skipped
   }
   ```
2. Inject it through `background/composition/lifecycle.ts` and call it from the
   focused `onInstalled` `"update"` lifecycle.
3. Add a fallback call from `App.tsx` init if needed (for cases where the service worker was inactive during install).
4. Add a message handler gated with `isExtensionPage(sender)` if the fallback needs it.

### Migration history

| Version | Migration                                                               | What it does                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| v1.0.0  | `migrateFromLegacyStorage`                                              | Creates `accounts` array + `activeAccountId` from legacy `address` / `encryptedApiKey` storage (v0.1.1/v0.2.0 had no multi-account system). Current code serializes the update/UI fallback race and repairs stale or missing active IDs left by older builds. |
| v1.0.0  | Vault key (on first unlock)                                             | `authHandlers.ts` auto-migrates `encryptedApiKey` → `encryptedVaultKeyMaster` + `encryptedApiKeyVault`                                                                                                                                           |
| v1.3.0  | Private key vault-key encryption (on first unlock with master password) | `authHandlers.ts` auto-migrates `pkVault` entries from password encryption (`salt !== ""`) to vault-key encryption (`salt === ""`). At that release, seed phrases remained master-password encrypted in V1 `mnemonicVault`; their derived signing keys lived in `pkVault`. Current code still reads that V1 format, while explicit biometric setup can atomically convert it to the V2 dedicated-mnemonic-key format described below. Enables agent password to sign transactions. Idempotent, dual-format support maintained for private keys. |
| v3.2.0  | None (additive only)                                                    | `selectedThemeId` added to `chrome.storage.local`. Absence resolves to default `"bauhaus"`, so legacy users see no change. No migration code required. See `_docs/THEMING_PRD.md`.                                                              |
| v3.17.0 | Fresh-install theme initialization                                      | New installs write `selectedThemeId: "midnight"` before onboarding opens. Updates do not write the key, and missing/invalid values still fall back to `"bauhaus"` so existing installs are not auto-changed. No storage shape change.          |
| next    | Transactional onboarding + lazy/authenticated key hardening             | Fresh setup writes the additive, non-secret `onboardingInitialization` marker before any wallet material. Missing is normal for existing users; a complete wallet is never rolled back because marker cleanup failed, while an owned/abandoned incomplete setup can be removed safely. `passkeyUnlock` is created only after explicit biometric setup. Missing data means biometric unlock is disabled. V1 passkeys remain readable; passkey setup atomically adds the V2 dedicated-key mnemonic vault and authenticated key check, while ordinary password unlock does not rewrite V1 phrases. A partial older `encryptedVaultKeyMaster` + legacy `encryptedApiKey` state converts on the next master unlock, while passkey/agent unlock fails clearly until then. Missing/invalid `autoLockTimeout` becomes the finite 15-minute default; an exact stored `0` remains explicit Never. Browsers without native `storage.session` proactively delete old fallback password-recovery halves and keep Never sessions in memory only; the cleanup also removes stale local fallback ciphertext after a browser later gains native session support without disrupting a valid current native session. Wallet reset rotates `walletConnectStorageNamespace` so replacement wallets cannot inherit SDK sessions, and clears bounded encrypted `sponsoredTransferIntents` retry state. Optional pending-request authority/tag fields and `txHistory.broadcastUncertain` are additive; old stored rows remain decodable and routes fail closed rather than guessing missing authority. No install-time secret decryption or destructive key-format migration is required. Reset, passkey removal, and master-password change clear the passkey wrapper. |

### Testing an update locally

1. Build and load the current extension as unpacked
2. Complete onboarding normally
3. Open the **service worker** DevTools console and strip the new storage to simulate an old user:
   ```js
   // Simulate v0.2.0 storage state
   chrome.storage.local.remove([
     "accounts",
     "encryptedVaultKeyMaster",
     "encryptedApiKeyVault",
     "agentPasswordEnabled",
   ]);
   chrome.storage.sync.remove(["activeAccountId", "tabAccounts"]);
   ```
4. Click **Reload** on `chrome://extensions` (fires `onInstalled` with `reason === "update"`)
5. Open the popup — should show unlock screen, not onboarding
6. Enter password — vault key migration runs on unlock
7. Verify the service worker console shows: `[WalletChan] Legacy storage migration complete: 0x...`

### Pre-release checklist (storage)

Before every release that touches `chrome.storage`:

- [ ] List all storage keys added, removed, or changed
- [ ] For each change: does a user on the previous release have data in the old format?
- [ ] If yes: is there a migration that converts old → new?
- [ ] Is the migration idempotent and does it run without the wallet being unlocked?
- [ ] Test the upgrade path locally using the steps above

## Security Notes

- **Never commit the .pem file** to the repository (it's in `.gitignore`)
- The website API caches GitHub responses for 5 minutes to avoid rate limits
- CWS publishing info and permission justifications are in `CHROME_WEBSTORE.md`
