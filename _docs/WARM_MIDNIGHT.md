# Warm Midnight Surface Handoff

> Status: active screen-by-screen brand review
> Last updated: 2026-07-14
> Scope: WalletChan browser-extension presentation and interaction only

This is the practical handoff document for continuing the Warm Midnight UI
review in fresh sessions. It records the decisions approved during the live
screen-by-screen redesign, distinguishes finished work from pending work, and
prevents older UI plans from overriding the current product direction.

This document does not replace the permanent design system in
[`DESIGN.md`](../DESIGN.md). `DESIGN.md` defines why WalletChan looks and feels
the way it does. This document defines what has been decided on each product
surface and what should happen next.

## 1. Reading order and authority

Every fresh UI session must read, in this order:

1. [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md), when present, for repository and verification
   rules.
2. [`DESIGN.md`](../DESIGN.md) for the permanent Warm Midnight brand system.
3. This document for approved surface decisions and current status.
4. [`STYLING.md`](./STYLING.md) before editing any UI component.
5. [`IMPLEMENTATION.md`](./IMPLEMENTATION.md) before changing extension logic,
   state, message passing, dapp behavior, authentication, or storage.
6. [`MASCOT.md`](./MASCOT.md) when the surface uses the WalletChan character.
7. [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md) before committing extension changes.

[`IMPROVE_UI.md`](./IMPROVE_UI.md) remains useful historical context for the
mobile-navigation migration and shadcn learnings, but its older screen targets
are not the source of truth for the current homepage. Production code plus the
approved decisions below take precedence.

## 2. Product direction

WalletChan should feel like a modern mobile wallet that is trustworthy for
financial decisions without becoming another anonymous corporate blue wallet.

The committed qualities are:

- **Trustworthy:** stable hierarchy, clear outcomes, restrained financial
  controls, and no decorative noise around risky decisions.
- **Precise:** aligned financial values, middle-truncated addresses, real chain
  and token identity, and explicit interaction states.
- **Approachable:** plain-language labels, one obvious next action, and mobile
  navigation instead of desktop modal stacks.
- **Spirited:** the WalletChan mascot, condensed wordmark, warm amber, and small
  playful reactions make the wallet recognizable.
- **Bold:** the product should have conviction and contrast, not the timid
  default-neutral appearance of a component-library demo.

The aesthetic is **Warm Midnight**: a near-black financial interface with
off-white typography, quiet graphite surfaces, WalletChan amber, full-color
identity assets, and blue reserved for transactional/focus roles.

## 3. Brand contract

### 3.1 Wordmark

- Explicit WalletChan logo/name lockups use the shared `BrandWordmark`.
- The wordmark uses self-hosted Anton and renders `WALLETCHAN` in uppercase.
- Use it in the extension header, unlock header, onboarding identity, and About
  identity.
- Do not use Anton for screen titles, settings labels, balances, buttons,
  technical content, or ordinary mentions of WalletChan.

### 3.2 Mascot

- The mascot is a primary brand asset, not generic decoration.
- It may lead unlock, onboarding, empty states, and success/reassurance moments.
- On the homepage, the mascot in the header is sufficient. Do not add another
  mascot beside the account or balance.
- Trust-critical confirmation screens remain information-first. Do not place a
  large mascot beside transaction outcomes, asset changes, fees, or approval
  limits.
- Follow the packaged-asset and motion guidance in `MASCOT.md`; avoid
  creating one-off character behavior inside screens.

### 3.3 Color responsibilities

- Neutral graphite surfaces carry most of the interface.
- Amber is WalletChan's brand signature. Use it for the brand Unlock action,
  selected Warm Midnight accents, the emphasized homepage Send shortcut, the
  final single-transaction `Confirm` action, the EIP-7702 `Set delegate`
  commitment action, all saved-state commitments (`Save`, `Save changes`,
  `Save contact`, and equivalent save labels), and small identity/attention
  moments. Saved-state commitments always use the amber `brand` button variant.
- Blue remains the default transactional, selection, link, and focus family
  unless a surface has received an explicit Warm Midnight exception. The final
  single-transaction `Confirm` button is one such exception and must use the
  amber `brand` variant, not `primary`; saved-state commitments follow the same
  rule.
- Green and red are semantic gain/receive and loss/send/error colors.
- Chain, token, protocol, account, and dapp artwork keeps its real colors.
- Amber must not fill every action. Its scarcity is what makes WalletChan
  recognizable.

### 3.4 Surface language

- Standard Midnight borders are 1px.
- Prefer alignment, spacing, lightness, and separators to another card.
- One outer surface may own a list; its child rows should not each become cards.
- Resting cards do not need shadows. Shadows belong to actual floating layers.
- Avoid transparency on popover content. `surface.overlay` is a scrim token, not
  a floating-content background.
- Controls generally use an 8px radius; top-level surfaces and sheets use 12px.
- Full/pill radius is for avatars, token/chain icons, statuses, and real pills.

### 3.5 Type and icons

- Midnight product typography stays restrained and readable; the wordmark is
  the deliberate display-font exception.
- Financial values use tabular numerals.
- Addresses, hashes, and raw identifiers use the mono face and middle
  truncation.
- Icon-only actions need accessible names and visible hover/focus states.
- Chain icons in lists and floating menus are circular. Transparent or dark
  glyph logos receive a neutral/light chip in Midnight so they remain visible.
- Dapp favicons receive a physical light background where transparent artwork
  would disappear against Midnight.

## 4. Mobile interaction contract

- Treat the popup, detached popup, and sidepanel as a mobile app viewport.
- Keep native touch, wheel, trackpad, and keyboard scrolling, but hide visual
  scrollbar chrome across application surfaces.
- Substantial destinations push as full screens with Back.
- Searchable or long selections use full-screen pickers.
- Two to six contextual actions use a bottom action sheet.
- A small hover/context choice may use a popover.
- Dialogs are reserved for blocking decisions, destructive confirmation, QR,
  or media inspection.
- Do not reintroduce large desktop dropdowns, nested modals, or sheets for
  hierarchical navigation.
- A bottom sheet must respect the same centered maximum content width as the
  homepage in wide popup-window and sidepanel layouts.
- Hover-triggered content must remain open while the pointer moves from the
  trigger into the content. Keyboard and focus behavior must remain usable.

### 4.1 Interaction sound contract

- Sound is a small reinforcement for meaningful outcomes, never a continuous
  soundtrack or a substitute for visible feedback.
- Prefer brief cues for confirmation, incoming requests, action-sheet
  transitions, and a few high-confidence state changes. Do not add audio to
  routine navigation, typing, scrolling, transaction amounts, or every button
  press. The approved hover exception is limited to portfolio token rows plus
  Send, Swap, Shield, and More; those cues are fine-pointer-only and
  rate-limited by the manager.
- Product surfaces request semantic cues from `sounds/soundManager.ts`; they do
  not import Cuelume or choose recipe names directly.
- Settings → Sounds owns one global `soundsEnabled` preference. It defaults on,
  is stored locally on the browser, and immediately applies across open
  extension views. Every future cue must respect it.
- Sound playback is enhancement-only. Authentication, confirmation, errors,
  and accessibility must remain fully understandable when audio is blocked or
  disabled.
- High-frequency value feedback uses the WalletChan-owned value pulse: 520Hz
  sine, 1500Hz low-pass, 5ms attack, and 45ms decay. The chart cue is limited
  to one pulse per 26ms and tracks actual visible NumberFlow changes rather
  than raw pointer events.
- Sliders play a short custom tick for actual non-snap value changes, capped at
  one per 26ms. Normalize into the 0/25/50/75/100 snap stops before playback,
  discard repeats inside one snap band, and play Cuelume `release` once when
  entering a different stop.
- Portfolio token hover uses a shorter sibling of that voice: the same sine
  and filter with a 2ms attack and 12ms decay. Keep its fine-pointer-only
  behavior and 140ms cooldown so quickly crossing the list stays restrained.

## 5. Approved surface decisions

### 5.1 Unlock

The unlock screen is the first completed Warm Midnight brand surface.

- Keep the compact WalletChan wordmark header and hamburger/menu entry.
- The animated mascot is the central identity moment.
- The instruction below the mascot is centered and reads
  `Enter password to unlock`.
- The input placeholder is `Password`.
- Remove generic `Welcome back` and `Unlock your wallet to continue` copy.
- Remove the local-decryption/trust-information box from this screen.
- The primary Unlock action uses the amber brand treatment.
- Keep biometric unlock as the secondary large action when configured.
- Pending requests use a lifted graphite notice directly below the header.
  Its soft subtle frame retains the rounded unlock-screen treatment, while its
  spacing and placement mirror the homepage pending-request banner: a bare
  ringing bell at left, one centered label, and a bare chevron at right. The
  unlock version stays graphite instead of using the homepage's full amber
  fill, and stays still when reduced motion is requested. The count includes
  unresolved Safe proposals as well as ordinary transaction, signature, batch,
  and permission prompts. A Safe-only queue reads **N Pending Safe Requests**;
  mixed queues retain the generic **N Pending Requests** label. Proposal
  details remain hidden until the wallet is unlocked.
- `Forgot password?` appears only after an incorrect password.
- An incorrect-password label occupies a reserved position at the input's top
  right so the rest of the layout does not move.
- Invalid submission shakes the input; reduced motion receives a safe fallback.

Mascot lifecycle:

- Empty password, including input focus: sleeping.
- First typed character: attentive.
- Correct password or successful biometric ceremony: brief success state with
  sparkles and one quiet sparkle cue, followed by the screen fade.
- Incorrect password: invalid/concerned state with Manpu.
- Automatic biometric prompt: attentive while the OS prompt is active.
- Cancelled biometric prompt: return to the password-mode flow.
- Manual biometric retry follows the same attentive/success/cancel behavior.
- A visible success state is held for 500ms before fading so the reaction can
  be perceived; reduced motion uses the shorter documented timing.
- Password unlock must not trigger a passkey prompt after the homepage appears.
- Successful biometric unlock must not trigger a second passkey prompt.

- `components/unlockMascotState.ts`
- `components/pendingUnlockRequestLabel.ts`
- `components/SafeAccount/usePendingSafeProposalCount.ts`
- `sounds/soundManager.ts`

### 5.2 App header

- Keep one mascot/logo at the left and the Anton WalletChan wordmark.
- Keep Lock, Settings, and the compact menu affordance.
- Do not restore the `$WCHAN`, WalletChan OS, or other permanent promotional
  banner.
- Do not add a second mascot elsewhere on the homepage.

### 5.3 Homepage account identity

- Use one compact account surface.
- The whole account surface opens the account picker.
- Show account avatar and display/ENS name on the first line.
- Show the middle-truncated address below it with tightly grouped QR, copy, and
  explorer actions where applicable.
- Copy and explorer actions prevent the parent account-picker behavior.
- Preserve a stable right-side chevron and sufficient separation between it
  and the address actions at every supported width.
- Address text may grow when the popup grows, but must yield before action
  buttons and the chevron.
- Do not show `Private key`, `Seed phrase`, `Bankr`, or another wallet-type tag
  in the homepage account card.
- Wallet-type details remain available inside account management.

There is no global homepage network selector. Without a connected dapp, a
global chain has no useful meaning.

Account explorer behavior:

- Clicking the explorer icon directly opens the active address on Ethereum
  Etherscan.
- Hovering the icon opens an opaque popover below it.
- The pointer can move into the popover without closing it.
- The popover lists enabled networks that have explorers; selecting one opens
  the active address on that network's explorer.
- Rows use round chain icons and Midnight visibility chips for transparent
  artwork.
- Explorer hover uses WalletChan amber, matching token-address explorer actions.

Relevant files:

- `components/AccountSwitcher.tsx`
- `components/AccountExplorerMenu.tsx`
- `components/AccountNetworkControls.tsx`
- `components/MiddleTruncatedAddress.tsx`

### 5.4 Per-tab account and chain model

Do not undo these functional behaviors while styling account or dapp surfaces:

- Each browser tab maintains its own selected account and injected-dapp chain.
- A tab initially inherits the most recently active account.
- After selection, changing another tab does not overwrite it.
- Dapps receive the account selected for their tab.
- An account switch emits `accountsChanged` only to a permitted dapp in that
  tab.
- A new tab inherits the account that was most recently active in the wallet.
- Transaction and signature requests remain pinned to the initiating tab's
  account.

See the Account Selection and Address Synchronization sections of
`IMPLEMENTATION.md` before changing this flow.

### 5.5 Portfolio balance and quick actions

- Portfolio balance is the primary homepage value.
- Keep one stable four-column row: Send, Swap, Shield, More.
- Every action owns an equal column and a consistent compact target; expansion
  to popup-window or sidepanel width must not produce large uneven gaps.
- The Send shortcut is the amber Warm Midnight emphasis.
- Other actions remain quiet neutral/brand-supporting controls.
- WalletConnect activity is represented by a small notification dot on More,
  not a promotional card above the account.
- The WalletConnect submenu entry carries the corresponding highlighted state.
- Safe accounts reuse this exact row. Capability may disable Send, while Swap
  and Shield stay visible but disabled until Safe proposal flows exist.
- Do not add Approvals or Security buttons beneath the shared row. Pending Safe
  proposals use one compact amber banner near the account identity: official
  Safe mark, **Pending Safe Requests**, one total such as **2 pending
  requests**, and a quiet **View** cue. The complete banner is the action
  target. Account settings remains the security destination.
- Safe Activity rows truncate action and origin context independently, convert
  serialized service-origin JSON into a human app label, and suppress the
  ordinary empty-transaction state whenever proposal activity is visible.
- Terminal Safe Activity rows open as receipt-style **Transaction details**,
  not live request reviews. Keep the originating dapp identity, Safe calls,
  signer record, status, hashes, and explorer route; do not re-run simulation,
  refresh approval authority, claim that a connected site is still waiting,
  expose signing/execution/rejection controls, or render a sticky action footer.
  Executed uses the semantic green checked pill, while Replaced and Cancelled
  remain quiet neutral outcomes. Pending Activity rows may still open the live
  request flow because they remain actionable.
- Safe Requests uses an official Safe-marked app header, the standard account
  identity/address utilities, a quiet header reload action, and one
  separator-owned list. Rows use a chain logo, plain-language action, a
  wallet/contact-resolved counterparty, and a compact color-independent
  lifecycle label. Give each row a muted upper-left **Nonce #N** label using the
  transaction's actual Safe nonce; same-nonce alternatives deliberately repeat
  that value. Future Safe nonces may reference it with **Blocked · Execute nonce
  #N first**; use a centered middle dot and do not show this copy for
  non-sequencing failures. Do
  not repeat the chain name or Safe-service origin in the row. There is no
  standalone raw proposal form; reviewed wallet and dapp actions create
  requests.
- Keep unsigned **Reject** as the neutral secondary beside approval or
  execution. If no signature exists it rejects locally; after any signature it
  reads **Reject onchain**, uses the shared red danger treatment from signature
  rejection, and opens a separately reviewed same-nonce rejection proposal.
  That proposal uses **Sign rejection** and **Execute rejection** as its amber
  commitment verbs. Its review keeps the no-asset-change summary to one
  subdued, normal-weight line, titles the action **Reject pending transaction
  #N** in the same secondary treatment, and places the semantic yellow **Needs
  approval** pill at the right edge of the **Request details** heading row.
  Locally **Available** signers use the same warning treatment. Back performs
  navigation only, and no pending signed row receives a dismiss/hide shortcut.
- Once execution crosses the broadcast boundary, replace the commitment action
  with passive **Confirming onchain…** copy. Do not show Execute again, a normal
  **Reconcile status** action, a green submitted-success panel, or a red error
  panel for ordinary broadcast uncertainty. The state pill and footer carry
  progress while background receipt reconciliation runs; deterministic failure
  remains a labeled error only after reconciliation proves it. When every
  trusted receipt RPC is unavailable, add one semantic-yellow notice reading
  **RPC unavailable. WalletChan will keep checking automatically.** This is a
  retrying infrastructure condition, not a red execution failure.

Relevant file: `components/HomeQuickActions.tsx`.

### 5.6 Injected dapp connection and homepage dock

WalletChan now requires explicit account-visibility permission before an
injected dapp receives accounts.

- A first connection request opens a full-screen confirmation.
- Permission is stored per exact trusted origin, not per account.
- Returning approved sites do not prompt unnecessarily.
- Whichever account the user selects for that tab is available to the approved
  site.
- Account access is not restricted to a manually selected subset of addresses.
- Connected dapps remain manageable even when their tab is no longer open.

Homepage dock rules:

- The dock exists only on the homepage.
- Send and Swap/Bridge use their own token/network context and do not show it.
- If the current tab has no connected dapp, render no dock row at all.
- The dock must update when navigation changes the URL within the same tab; it
  must not require switching away and back.
- When connected, the left region shows the dapp favicon, hostname, and
  `Connected` status.
- Hovering the connected status changes it to a padded red `Disconnect?`
  action without disturbing the rest of the dock.
- Disconnect is not duplicated inside the chain sheet.
- Only the right chain region opens the network sheet.
- The right-region highlight hugs the chain icon/name content with padding; it
  must not paint an arbitrary half of the dock.

Dapp network sheet:

- Mobile bottom sheet, approximately 75% viewport height.
- Respect the homepage maximum width in wider windows/sidepanels.
- Include search at the top.
- Sort networks with the largest portfolio balances first.
- Show a small wallet/money icon beside a non-zero USD balance.
- When a network balance is zero, leave the balance line empty.
- Use round chain icons and visibility chips for transparent/dark logos.
- Keep the dapp favicon on a physical light background where necessary.

Connected-dapp management:

- `More` contains a `Connected dapps` submenu entry rather than rendering the
  entire list inline.
- The submenu lists every persisted permission, not only currently open tabs.
- The left/main portion of a dapp row opens the site in a new tab.
- The entire trailing remove region is clickable and visually separated; it
  revokes the permission so a future connection request prompts again.

Relevant files:

- `components/DappConnectionConfirmation.tsx`
- `components/HomeDappDock.tsx`
- `components/DappSiteIcon.tsx`
- `components/ConnectedDappsView.tsx`
- `components/MoreActionsView.tsx`
- `chrome/dapp/connectionHandlers.ts`
- `chrome/requests/dappPermissionStorage.ts`

### 5.7 Portfolio tabs and chart

- Root destinations are Assets, Positions, and Activity.
- Selected Midnight tab uses the restrained amber underline, not a permanent
  blue outlined tab.
- The chart remains secondary to the total balance.
- Positive chart color is semantic green.
- Use a curved path rather than sharp linear corners.
- Chart and token-list edges align cleanly.
- Avoid the bottom-right double-radius artifact between chart and holdings.
- Keep vertical spacing compact between tabs, performance label, chart, filter,
  and list.

### 5.8 Assets controls

- The network filter, search action, and vertical three-dot menu sit below the
  chart and immediately above the token list.
- Search is an icon at rest. Clicking it replaces the control row with a full
  search input.
- The input filters holdings by token name or symbol.
- Search and clear icons are vertically centered and the clear hover target
  does not become an oversized floating block.
- The portfolio menu opens a mobile action sheet containing:
  - Refresh portfolio
  - Unify balances and Auto filter chain
  - Add custom token
  - Hide tokens
- Group refresh, display preferences, and token management with spacing and
  dividers between groups. Keep labels and icons at full foreground contrast;
  actions use semibold labels, preferences use regular weight, and enabled
  preferences retain amber checkmarks.
- Use compact sheet density with 44px action targets and 4px on each side of
  group dividers to keep the five-option menu short.
- Do not restore separate `+` and reload buttons beside the network filter.

### 5.9 Asset rows and token action sheet

- Token logos and token typography are deliberately compact.
- The complete row is one click target.
- Remove inline copy and three-dot actions from the row.
- Clicking a token opens its action sheet.
- The sheet respects the same maximum width as the homepage/network sheet.
- Header format is a single line: token logo + token name + `on` + chain logo +
  chain name.
- Actions include icons and use this order:
  1. Send
  2. Swap
  3. Address, when the asset has a real contract address
  4. Edit token, for locally editable tokens
  5. Hide token, isolated at the bottom
- Address uses middle truncation and keeps copy/explorer beside the `Address`
  label.
- Native assets must not show a fake `0x0000...` address entry.
- Hide token is red on the neutral resting surface. In Bauhaus, its red filled
  hover uses a contrasting visible foreground.

### 5.10 Aggregate assets

When `All networks` is selected, WalletChan aggregates canonical copies of
specific assets across supported built-in mainnets:

- ETH, only on built-in mainnets where ETH is the native currency.
- Canonical USDC, using the verified address map in `canonicalTokens.ts`.
- Canonical USDT, using the verified address map in `canonicalTokens.ts`.
- Do not aggregate arbitrary same-symbol tokens, bridged lookalikes, testnets,
  or custom networks without verified canonical identity.

Aggregate row behavior:

- Show combined token amount and USD value.
- Show `N networks` beside the symbol.
- Place the disclosure arrow immediately beside the network count so the row
  remains aligned with ordinary holdings.
- Expanded chain rows use the token logo with a smaller chain badge overlay,
  consistent with normal asset identity.
- The expanded region uses a slightly lighter surface and square joins; do not
  create a rounded nested card.

### 5.11 Low-value assets

- The low-value group is a noise-control mechanism, not a strict price rule.
- Always keep up to the four largest holdings outside the group.
- Only create the low-value group when the account has at least five holdings.
- If an account has only one to four low-value assets, show them normally.
- The collapsed summary shows `Low-value assets`, combined value, and the asset
  count. Remove the redundant `Assets worth less than $0.10 each` line.
- Keep the asset count on one line at compact widths.
- Expanding the group scrolls the page just enough to bring its holdings into
  view.

### 5.12 Network filter

- `All networks` is the default portfolio scope.
- The filter picker must not clip selected-row corner/focus treatment.
- Long custom-network and testnet names remain readable.
- Chain logos are round and receive a visibility chip where needed.

### 5.13 Activity

- Activity uses one defined-edge list surface below the shared network filter.
  Date groups are quiet recessed section markers inside that owner; they are
  not separate cards and do not introduce decorative rules outside the list.
- Transaction rows reuse the Assets list grid and spacing: compact identity at
  left, intent and context in the flexible middle column, and tabular financial
  or status metadata on one trailing rail.
- Rows use a 64px compact rhythm. Explorer controls stay at the 24px minimum
  target height so they do not inflate the intent line or detach it from the
  context line below. Bridge rows add one 2px spacing step between their two
  lines to offset the denser dual-chain explorer treatment.
- Keep each row to two scanning lines. Long non-financial intents may span the
  complete content width; sends reserve the trailing first line for the signed
  amount. Function selectors are converted to readable sentence case.
- Intent and context use character-level single-line truncation, preserving the
  readable beginning of long actions and hostnames instead of dropping the
  complete final word at compact widths.
- Outgoing amounts keep a visible minus sign and semantic loss color. Exact
  1-99,999 base-unit values for 18-decimal assets use `wei`; other tiny values
  stay as readable decimals when room permits and switch to subscript-zero
  notation at compact widths. Dust beyond the row's six-decimal summary
  precision is omitted rather than rendering a misleading zero tail; exact
  precision remains available in transaction details.
- Status is an inline icon plus label, never a detached pill. Confirmed,
  pending, failed, bridge, and force-inclusion states remain understandable
  without color and share the second trailing line with relative time.
- The complete transaction identity/content area opens the full-screen detail
  destination. Explorer actions occupy the first line's rightmost edge while
  status and relative time occupy the second line's rightmost edge. The row
  uses an overlay details button with explorer siblings, so explorer clicks
  never open details and fulfilled bridges expose distinct chain-marked links.
- Activity, Assets, and Positions retain independent scroll offsets. Activity
  remains mounted while hidden so its async history load cannot collapse the
  shared scroll owner, and returning from transaction details reapplies the
  saved offset after history content is ready.
- Cached token media follows the same inert-image rule as Assets: transparent,
  unavailable, or stale cache entries render visible symbol initials.
- Address-bearing send and clear-signing context resolves against the current
  contact book and wallet account names instead of freezing the historical
  label. Contact add/edit broadcasts and account add/rename broadcasts update
  mounted Activity rows immediately, including while the tab is hidden.
- Different-asset swaps and bridges use a lightly overlapping horizontal pair
  of readable token marks in source-to-destination order. Same-asset bridges
  collapse duplicate marks into one larger token identity; their title and
  right-edge explorer controls already communicate the chain transition.
- Website and protocol favicons use the same rounded-square identity frame as
  Positions and fill a 28px frame edge to edge inside the stable 32px media
  slot, while tokens and chain identities remain circular. Shape alone
  therefore separates dapp activity from asset activity at scanning speed.
- The full filtered history remains available in the Activity scroll owner;
  the root tab does not silently truncate after ten entries.
- Preview coverage uses deterministic send, swap, batch, bridge, name-service,
  pending, and failed entries and is reviewed at compact, popup, popup-window,
  and sidepanel widths in both themes and all three signing wallet fixtures.

- `components/Activity/useActivityExplorers.ts`
- `components/Activity/activityModel.ts`

### 5.14 Add account

- The root Add account screen is a concise 2-by-2 account-type launcher.
- Private key, seed phrase, Bankr API, and view-only setup each open as a
  focused child screen with their own title, fields, validation, and action.
- Back from a type-specific screen returns to the account-type launcher; Back
  from the launcher returns to the account list.
- Keep Bankr visibly unavailable when a Bankr account already exists, without
  hiding the account type.
- Keep the launcher surfaces neutral, with restrained semantic color confined
  to the account-type icons. Bankr uses its real product mark rather than a
  generic bot glyph.
- Seed phrase setup continues to expose saved seed groups for deriving another
  address before offering a new phrase flow. When no saved group exists,
  selecting Seed phrase opens the import-or-create choice directly instead of
  showing an empty interstitial.
- Final account-creation actions use the amber brand treatment. Validation,
  encryption, and background account handlers remain unchanged.
- Safe setup is a compact two-path flow: Find by owner or enter a Safe address.
  Use Safe's official monogram for Safe identity. Owner discovery needs no
  permanent helper copy; manual entry keeps one short supporting line.
  Discovery mechanics belong in progress and error states.
- In the untouched state, a quiet horizontal divider with centered **or**
  separates owner discovery from manual entry. Owner discovery has no helper
  copy inside or above its selector. Selecting an owner removes the divider and
  complete manual-address path, leaving discovery and Safe results in focus.
- Owner selection or change immediately shows a horizontally centered spinner
  and **Finding Safes…** status. Once the visible-network total resolves, the
  same stable status row reports **Checked 0 of N networks…** and advances with
  each batch; there is no empty transition between selection and progress.
- Manual Safe-address scanning centers its **Checking networks…** spinner and
  status in the same way, keeping progress treatment consistent across paths.
- When a selected or manually entered Safe resolves, bring the **Verified
  Safe** heading to the start of the scroll area. Match transaction Advanced
  details: smooth movement normally and instant movement under reduced motion.
- Discovered Safe rows keep the address as a large independent selection
  target. Copy and first-verified-chain explorer controls sit beside it as
  separate 24px actions, followed by the verified-chain marks; utility actions
  never select the Safe.
- Safe import review does not repeat the address or a verified-network count.
  Verified-chain logos sit beside the section heading; each defined-edge chain
  card leads with network identity, then labeled threshold and balance facts,
  followed by plain-language owner rows. Safe version is quiet metadata and
  the explorer remains attached to its chain.

### 5.15 Transaction review

- The screen follows one decision path: requesting dapp and plain-language
  action, estimated balance changes, clear-signed request details, then
  advanced tooling.
- The former `Expected outcome` box is replaced by a compact masthead. Dapp
  identity and chain establish context first; the action follows beneath one
  separator without repeating the hostname in oversized copy.
- A small amber review marker supplies WalletChan warmth without competing
  with the final amber Confirm action.
- Request details read as a compact ledger with sentence-case labels, neutral
  network identity, row separators, and no duplicated origin/signer rows.
- Asset direction remains explicit in text and signed amounts. Do not use a
  decorative colored rail beside every asset row. The parent owns the
  `Estimated changes` heading; the simulator must not add a second disclosure
  heading inside it.
- The pinned decision region shows the signing account and network fee above
  Reject/Confirm. Local accounts expose Slow, Standard, Fast, and Custom in an
  anchored upward popover; opening it must never move the action buttons out of
  the viewport. Bankr keeps its managed-fee readout.
- Calldata, digest, Tenderly, and batching controls remain behind Advanced
  details. Technical surfaces use defined edges without resting shadows.
  Midnight's active calldata tab uses a thin amber rule rather than a second
  filled action color.
- The final single-transaction `Confirm` button uses `variant="brand"` so the
  commit action is WalletChan amber. Do not replace it with the blue `primary`
  variant during confirmation refactors. Reject remains the neutral secondary
  action.
- Preserve every simulation warning, copy/explorer affordance, pending-request
  control, force-inclusion option, and Bankr/private-key/seed-phrase execution
  path while changing this composition.

### 5.16 Transaction details

- Transaction details is the post-submission counterpart to transaction review,
  not a separate dashboard. It follows the same readable hierarchy: requesting
  identity and network status, actual balance changes, human-readable action,
  compact transaction metadata, then technical diagnostics.
- Confirmed, pending, and failed state always pairs its semantic color with an
  icon and text. Failure detail follows the status immediately; bridge progress
  names its terminal or in-flight state.
- Actual asset movement reuses the request review's explicit Send and Receive
  direction groups, signed tabular values, token identity fallbacks, and
  destination-chain context. A bridge uses one compact directional ledger with
  source and destination chain identities, aligned signed token values,
  chain-correct explorer actions, settlement state, and the provider route.
- Transaction details does not repeat the already-established chain in the
  Balance changes heading. Token identities use the request-review 28px scale,
  expose the shared contract popover, and align counterparty metadata beneath
  the symbol. Non-zero dust remains visible through exact wei or compact
  subscript-zero notation.
- Human-readable submission snapshots paint synchronously. ERC-7730 descriptors
  may enrich the same rounded summary surface with decoded fields, but must not
  replace it with a loading, empty, or visually detached card. Current
  wallet/contact labels continue to win inside shared address controls.
- Same-chain swaps use one Action/From/To ledger; EIP-7702 delegation changes
  use Action/Delegate/Policy or Result rows; ERC-7715 revocations retain their
  receipt-specific permission ledger. Generic deployments and undecoded calls
  still show a truthful Action row while leaving Advanced details open.
- Atomic batch calls keep the shared call list and amber count. Sequential
  fallback receipts identify the submitted call number without presenting the
  execution as atomic. Force inclusion uses one L1-deposit/L2-inclusion ledger,
  and broadcast uncertainty remains an explicit in-progress state.
- Compact post-submission metadata owns the paid or maximum gas-fee pill, the
  signing-account identity pill, sequential-call context, and centered quiet
  timestamp. Fiat leads the comfortably padded gas pill, with three meaningful
  native decimals beneath and full native precision available on hover and in
  its accessible name. The
  transaction hash is not repeated: the primary correct-chain explorer action
  sits beside the chain in the status line. Force-inclusion's distinct L1/L2
  links remain in its progress ledger.
- Function, From/To, raw value, calldata/deploy bytes, and gas diagnostics live
  behind one native Advanced details disclosure. Technical surfaces use one
  defined edge, quiet separators, and no resting shadow.
- Preserve force-inclusion L1/L2 state and explorer links, rebroadcast behavior,
  receipt enrichment, bridge settlement data, metadata fallback, back-scroll
  restoration, and wallet-type-neutral history rendering.

### 5.17 dapp3 browser

- The standalone `browse.html` launcher uses the canonical Midnight graphite
  elevation ramp rather than its legacy emerald-on-black palette.
- Amber is reserved for the mascot spotlight, Open action, example hover, and
  fallback dapp identity; keyboard focus remains financial blue.
- The resolver is one focused decision path with a visible field label,
  inline text error, and native keyboard-operable controls.
- Favorite dapps appear first and may represent either resolver-backed sites or
  ordinary HTTP(S) dapps saved from the connected list. Connected dapps follow
  in a three-row scroll region, with last-used context, direct canonical-origin
  navigation, and hover/focus favorite and disconnect actions. Recent
  ENS/GNS/onchain dapps remain last in the same restrained, responsive
  4/3/2-column tile grammar.
- The resolver input filters connected dapps by hostname, title, and origin as
  the user types. Runtime/storage events plus focus and visibility reconciliation
  keep favorites, cached sites, and permissions current without page reload.
- The same field is a compact command surface: normal credential-free HTTPS
  URLs get a direct-open row, while free text receives debounced DefiLlama
  directory suggestions. The elevated graphite result list supports arrow-key
  selection, Escape dismissal, loading/error feedback, and safe-raster marks.
  Directory progress reuses the shared Midnight three-dot pulse used by
  simulation and gas estimation instead of introducing a browser-only loader.
- Suggestion rows preserve the launcher by opening their validated HTTPS dapp
  in a new tab. Hover, keyboard selection, or focus reveals a compact trailing
  star; it favorites the dapp without opening it and uses the same filled amber
  saved state as connected-dapp cards.
- The top-level browser-only connected-site read is bounded and sanitized;
  existing interstitial routing and remote-image safety remain unchanged.
- Image-backed dapp marks use the same near-white contrast canvas and neutral
  edge as More → Connected dapps so transparent dark artwork remains legible.
  Generated letter fallbacks and the browser mascot now use that same white
  canvas instead of an amber wrapper. Raster marks are larger with rounded
  image corners while the outer tile geometry stays fixed.
- A populated browser search field shows a bare 36px clear icon immediately to
  the left of Open, without a resting border or background. Clearing retains
  focus, closes the current result state, and leaves the field ready for a new
  query.

## 6. Logic and safety guardrails

Warm Midnight work is presentation-first. Do not casually change:

- Transaction, signature, clear-signing, simulation, batching, or swap logic.
- Password, passkey, vault, session, or agent-password behavior.
- Dapp permission trust derivation or storage shape.
- Per-tab account or chain routing.
- Portfolio token identity, canonical-address maps, or price calculations merely
  to make a row easier to render.
- The three wallet-type execution paths: Bankr/impersonator, private key, and
  seed phrase.

If a surface change requires any of the above, read `IMPLEMENTATION.md`,
`STORAGE.md`, `PUBLISHING.md`, and `SECURITY.md` as required by `AGENTS.md`, then
separate the functional change from the visual review where possible.

Every displayed `0x` address still follows the repository standard:

- Middle truncation where space is constrained.
- Inline copy feedback using Copy -> Check, never a toast.
- Correct-chain explorer link when chain context exists.
- The homepage account's no-global-chain exception defaults to Etherscan and
  offers other explorers through the hover popover.
- Saved Address Book labels are the first text identity across address,
  account, signer, and delegate surfaces, ahead of wallet names and public
  name/API labels. Resolved avatars remain independent and may still accompany
  the user label. Address overflow
  disclosures keep copy/explorer together and place Add/Edit contact beneath
  them. Batch-call targets use this same labeled-address pill instead of a
  separate copy/explorer chip. When adding a new contact from a pill, its
  current wallet, public-name, or API label seeds the Label field; raw and
  truncated address fallbacks do not. The Address Book itself uses the
  full-screen searchable list grammar.
  Contact rows keep the user label primary, show a cached public primary name
  instead of the truncated address when one exists, and replace the blockie
  with a safely cached resolved avatar when available. The deterministic
  blockie remains visible while an avatar loads and whenever none exists.
  Its address field resolves supported name services in place with quiet
  loading, resolved-address, and corrective error states before Save.
  Send autocomplete suggestions use the same compact avatar/name/address
  identity stack while preserving arrow-key, Enter, and Escape behavior.
  Selecting a known contact or wallet keeps that identity stable in the
  recipient header without a transient resolver status.
  The full Send contact group reuses the Address Book's editable row and
  deletion dialog, including its explicit drag handle. Pointer, touch, and
  keyboard reordering is available with an unfiltered list; searching keeps
  rows selectable and editable but pauses ordering until the filter is clear.
  A quiet plus action remains aligned to the Contacts heading in Send and opens
  the same shared Add contact dialog, including when no contacts are saved.

Recommended immediate order:

1. Positions populated list.
2. Positions empty/loading/error states.
3. Homepage loading/empty/RPC/stale states.
4. Homepage compact and wide responsive polish.
5. Only then run the broader homepage QA gate.

## 8. One-surface session protocol

This protocol is for extension UI work. For website-only changes, follow the
application-scoped validation guidance in `AGENTS.md` and `_docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`;
do not run extension builds during website iteration.

Each fresh chat should own one surface, not an entire phase.

1. Read the authority stack in section 1.
2. Inspect the production component and its real call site before proposing
   changes.
3. Treat the actual extension UI as truth. If a preview differs, fix preview
   fidelity before using it to judge the production design.
4. State the one visual task being attempted.
5. Make one small reviewable change.
6. Run only `pnpm build:extension` during the visual iteration unless the user
   explicitly requests broader checks.
7. Do not run Playwright, lint, typecheck, or repository-wide automation after
   every small adjustment.
8. Do not open preview URLs automatically.
9. Let the user inspect the extension and respond before starting the next
   visual task.
10. Once the complete surface is approved, run the proportionate quality and
    accessibility checks together.

The worktree may contain intentional WIP from other surfaces. Preserve unrelated
changes and never reset or clean them.

## 9. Fresh-session prompt template

Copy this into a new chat and replace the bracketed values:

```text
We are continuing WalletChan's Warm Midnight extension redesign, one surface at
a time.

Read AGENTS.md, DESIGN.md, _docs/WARM_MIDNIGHT.md, _docs/STYLING.md, and the
relevant parts of _docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md before editing. If this surface uses
the mascot, also read _docs/MASCOT.md.

Surface for this session: [POSITIONS / ACTIVITY / SEND / SWAP / ETC.]
Current task: [ONE SMALL VISUAL OR INTERACTION CHANGE]

Preserve all wallet logic and both themes. The production extension is the
source of truth. Work one change at a time and wait for my visual review after
each change. During iteration, only run pnpm build:extension; do not run the
broader QA scripts or automatically open preview pages.
```

## 10. Surface file map

| Surface | Primary files |
| --- | --- |
| Brand/header | `BrandWordmark.tsx`, header composition in `App.tsx` |
| Unlock | `UnlockScreen.tsx`, `UnlockMascot.tsx`, `unlockMascotState.ts` |
| Account identity | `AccountSwitcher.tsx`, `AccountExplorerMenu.tsx`, `AccountNetworkControls.tsx` |
| Quick actions | `HomeQuickActions.tsx` |
| Dapp connection | `DappConnectionConfirmation.tsx`, `HomeDappDock.tsx`, `DappSiteIcon.tsx` |
| Connected dapps | `ConnectedDappsView.tsx`, `MoreActionsView.tsx` |
| Portfolio composition | `PortfolioTabs.tsx`, `PortfolioChart.tsx` |
| Asset rows/sheets | `PortfolioHoldingRows.tsx`, `TokenHoldings.tsx`, `tokenHoldingsUtils.ts` |
| Positions | `TokenHoldings.tsx` and its DeFi position row helpers |
| Activity/detail | transaction list components, `TxDetailScreen.tsx`, `TxDetailModal.tsx` |
| Transaction detail composition | `components/TransactionDetails/`, `ClearSignedSummaryCard.tsx`, `preview/completedTransactionFixture.ts` |
| dapp3 browser | `pages/Dapp3Browser.tsx`, `pages/Dapp3Browser.css`, `browse.html` |
| Shared mobile primitives | `components/ui/` |
| Midnight tokens | `theme/themes/midnight.ts`, `theme/recipes/`, `theme/tokens.ts` |

Use `rg` to confirm the current owners before editing; file boundaries may
continue to improve as oversized components are split.

## 11. Known documentation drift

- `IMPROVE_UI.md` describes the completed professional/mobile migration but not
  every later Warm Midnight brand decision.
- Its older Home target mentions a combined account/network summary; the current
  homepage intentionally has no global network selector.
- `IMPLEMENTATION.md` contains authoritative behavior, but its broad Homepage
  Layout inventory may lag the current visual composition.
- `THEMING_PRD.md` is rollout history, not the current screen-review backlog.
- Preview documentation describes the harness, not approval status. A preview
  route is not automatically evidence that it matches the current production
  screen.

When a surface is approved, update this document's decision and status sections
in the same workstream so the next chat does not depend on conversation history.

## 12. Changelog

- 2026-07-20: completed the Safe account-settings leaf surface. It now uses the
  shared account identity, editable account name, and section/list grammar; one
  compact authority ledger per chain without redundant readiness/verified-block
  labels; middle-truncated explorer-aware addresses; and a deliberate removal
  dialog instead of browser-native confirmation. Added a deterministic settings
  scenario to the Safe preview route and verified the 320px and sidepanel
  compositions.
- 2026-07-18: promoted Favorite dapps above Connected dapps; added a three-row
  connected-site scroll region, launcher-input filtering, keyboard-accessible
  favorite/disconnect tile actions, HTTP(S) favorites independent of
  permission lifetime, and automatic open-page reconciliation.
- 2026-07-18: matched browse-page dapp logo wrappers to More → Connected dapps:
  real image marks use a light neutral canvas, while amber remains only on
  letter fallbacks.
- 2026-07-18: replaced the standalone dapp3 browser's emerald palette with
  canonical Warm Midnight graphite surfaces, amber identity/action emphasis,
  blue focus, accessible resolver labeling, and responsive dapp tiles. The
  launcher now also shows the same exact-origin HTTP(S) grants as More →
  Connected dapps through a narrow top-level-only public metadata projection.
- 2026-07-16: completed the Transaction-details variant matrix. Same-chain
  swaps, EIP-7702 set/revoke, ERC-7715 revoke, atomic and sequential batches,
  force inclusion, bridge pending/refund, broadcast uncertainty, deployments,
  and undecoded legacy calls now use intentional Warm Midnight receipt states;
  deterministic preview fixtures cover each path without oversized modules.
- 2026-07-16: replaced the request-oriented ERC-7715 revoke warning inside
  Transaction details with a receipt-specific ledger. The confirmed summary
  now uses stable Action, Permission, Requested by, Delegate, Asset, Limit,
  Methods, and Expires rows while preserving shared contact and token tools.
- 2026-07-16: replaced Transaction details' stacked bridge cards with one
  source-to-destination ledger aligned to the approved balance-change grammar:
  request-scale token marks with lower-right chain badges, clear directional
  headers, right-aligned token and fiat values, quiet explorer actions, and
  secondary route metadata.
- 2026-07-11: created the Warm Midnight surface handoff from the approved
  unlock, homepage identity, dapp, portfolio, asset-row, aggregation, and
  connected-dapp decisions; recorded Positions as the next review surface.
- 2026-07-14: refined the unlock pending-request state into a lifted graphite
  notice below the header, matching the homepage banner's bell/centered-label/
  chevron geometry while retaining a graphite surface and reduced-motion-safe
  repeating ring.
- 2026-07-16: rebuilt Transaction details as the receipt counterpart to Warm
  Midnight transaction review: requesting identity and explicit status, actual
  Send/Receive movement, synchronous clear-signed intent, compact bridge route,
  one signer/fee/hash receipt, and one advanced technical disclosure. Expanded
  deterministic previews now cover bridge, approval, transfer, metadata stress,
  and real Bankr/private-key/seed-phrase signing identities.
- 2026-07-16: refined Transaction details with clickable requesting-site
  identity, request-scale token media and contract popovers, aligned
  counterparty metadata, exact tiny-amount rendering, a bare Midnight
  clear-signing info mark, and the amber batch-call count.
- 2026-07-16: removed redundant Advanced-detail helper copy, aligned user-opened
  disclosures to the top of the detail viewport, replaced nested calldata's
  Bauhaus tabs with a quiet Midnight tab rule and amber function chip, promoted
  the existing decoder result into a contract/payment summary when clear
  signing is unavailable, and made the receipt hash an explorer action.
- 2026-07-16: converted decoded-function and clear-signing action headers into
  the same `Action` ledger row as the rest of Transaction summary, removed the
  redundant icon, and kept Advanced details closed whenever readable decoded
  intent is already presented above it.
- 2026-07-16: applied the approved Midnight decoded-parameter tab treatment to
  rich strings as well as nested bytes through one shared control; number-unit
  pickers and format toggles remain separate interactions rather than tabs.
