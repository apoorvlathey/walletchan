# Settings UI audit map

- `index.tsx` is the Settings screen router/composition root.
- `settingsRegistry.tsx` declares settings destinations and metadata.
- `AccountsSettings.tsx` adapts the shared account picker into a manage-only
  Settings destination; row activation opens account settings and never
  changes the active account.
- `ClearChatHistoryDialog.tsx` owns the root-level chat-history confirmation
  dialog while the Settings router retains the action state and deletion effect.
- `ExplorerEnhancementsSettings.tsx` owns the **Enhance Block Explorers**
  destination shown directly after Security and its default-on preference;
  the sync-storage write is observed live by explorer content scripts.
- `EditChain.tsx` composes the edit form and save/validation flow.
- `NetworkIdentityFields.tsx` renders the editable/read-only network name and
  chain-ID controls.
- `useEditChainRpcEndpoints.ts` composes endpoint history and built-in RPC
  persistence into the select/add/edit/remove actions consumed by Edit Chain.
- `RpcEndpointManager.tsx` composes the named saved-RPC dropdown, selected status,
  per-row edit actions, confirmed removal, and add/edit transition; it has no
  storage or network effects.
- `RpcEndpointEditor.tsx` and `RpcEndpointFavicon.tsx` own the full-width editor
  with a single-line URL field, label-row copy action, nested per-endpoint
  developer setting, and sanitized provider-favicon presentation respectively.
- `RpcEndpointRemoveDialog.tsx` owns the destructive endpoint-removal prompt.
- `ImpersonatedTransactionSetting.tsx` presents the per-RPC developer opt-in
  for unsigned `eth_sendTransaction` requests from view-only accounts.
- `AddChainAdvancedDetails.tsx` keeps explorer and native-token fields ahead of
  the nested, collapsed developer-only impersonation setting.
- `rpcEndpointModel.ts` owns pure URL/domain presentation helpers.
- `useNetworkRpcEndpoints.ts` loads the selected chain's local endpoint history
  and falls back to the active RPC while legacy wallets have no history record.
- `useBuiltInRpcPersistence.ts` probes active-endpoint changes and immediately
  persists built-in-chain endpoint selection/history through `updateNetwork`;
  inactive endpoint metadata edits retain the current runtime endpoint.
- `NetworkExplorerField.tsx` shows the explorer URL for every network and owns
  built-in explorer saving through the validated updateNetwork route.
- `CustomNetworkDetails.tsx` presents custom-chain native-currency
  fields behind the advanced disclosure.
- `AddChainRequestSummary.tsx` presents the standard dapp identity and proposed
  network summary for provider-originated add-chain decisions.
- `addChainModel.ts` keeps duplicate chain-ID/name validation pure while
  allowing an approval request to target the same hidden chain it was opened
  for.
- The remaining chain screens own network list and add-chain flows.
- Authentication screens own password, biometric, agent-factor, auto-lock, and
  sound preference flows. Agent-factor creation explicitly collects the
  current master password even during a passwordless passkey master session;
  the background remains responsible for validating that recovery proof.

Settings components call trusted renderer message routes but do not reproduce
background authorization, storage, RPC, or cryptographic policy. New settings
subfeatures should use a focused component or hook instead of growing the root
router.

`PrivacyRecoverySettings.tsx` is an export-only facade for the
`PrivacyRecovery/` feature folder. Its root owns temporary form/display state,
clipboard effects, and post-restore rescan orchestration; presentational leaves
own the chooser, concealed backup, balance-at-risk, two-confirmation, and
phrase-import layouts. The background owns password proof and vault mutation.
`PrivacyRecoverySettingsRow.tsx` keeps its agent-disabled
navigation presentation out of the Settings registry composition file.
