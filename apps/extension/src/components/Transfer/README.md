# Transfer UI audit map

`TokenTransfer.tsx` is the Send-screen composition root. The historical
`components/TokenTransfer.tsx` module is a policy-free compatibility facade so
existing direct and lazy imports retain the same default-export contract.

## Responsibilities

- `TokenTransfer.tsx` composes the screen, pickers, validation gates, and sticky
  actions. It does not fetch balances or publish transactions directly.
- `TokenSelectionSection.tsx` renders the chain/token card and adaptive balance.
- `RecipientSection.tsx` renders address resolution, copy/explorer actions, and
  the contract-recipient acknowledgement.
- `RecipientSafetyNotice.tsx` renders Send-only lookalike warnings, complete
  checksummed address comparisons with underlined differences, loading/retry,
  and the explicit full-address acknowledgement. It never substitutes an address.
- `AmountSection.tsx` renders amount mode, MAX, conversion, and the sound-aware
  percentage slider.
- `CalldataSection.tsx` renders native calldata, deployment mode, and decoding.
- `TransferNotices.tsx` renders sponsorship eligibility/status and view-only
  notices.
- `NetworkPicker.tsx` adapts Send's catalog balances and selection callback to
  the shared `NetworkSelector`. For a Safe account it keeps undeployed networks
  visible but disabled and ranks verified deployments first. The token picker's compact network pill opens
  that same searchable selector as a nested screen; choosing a network updates
  Send and returns directly to token discovery. `RecipientPicker.tsx` owns recipient-only
  search/rendering. Wallet rows use the canonical `AccountAvatar`, with Safe
  accounts pinned to the official Safe mark just like the selected-recipient
  identity chip. The Contacts group mounts shared `AddressContactList`, so
  Send and More expose the same identity row, edit/delete dialogs, and sortable
  controls rather than maintaining Send-specific contact UI. Search results
  remain selection/edit/delete only until the filter is cleared.
  Send enables the shared group's Add action and keeps the group visible when
  empty, making the name-service-aware contact editor reachable from the picker.
- `AdaptiveBalance.tsx` owns responsive balance measurement and formatting.
- `formatting.ts` contains pure display formatting/account labels; `types.ts`
  contains the public component contract.
- `model/sendEntry.ts` keeps Send entry semantics explicit: the homepage
  shortcut starts on Ethereum ETH, while an Assets-row entry preserves the
  clicked token and chain.
- The public Send token picker never receives Shielded ETH. Private Assets owns
  that identity and exposes only Shield, Unshield, and Privacy Pools Activity.
- `model/recipientSuggestions.ts` owns deterministic wallet/contact matching,
  cached-public-name matching, relevance ranking, and stored-order tie breaking
  for the recipient combobox. Focusing an empty recipient input exposes every
  eligible wallet and contact in group order; typed queries keep the bounded
  relevance-ranked results. Suggestion rows reuse the shared safe avatar and
  blockie fallback used by the full contact picker.

## Hooks and effects

- `hooks/useSendRecipientSafety.ts` reads the trusted-UI local recipient
  projection, refreshes on contact/history events, discards stale reads, and
  resets acknowledgement synchronously on recipient, sender, chain, or reference
  changes. Only `TokenTransfer` mounts it; shared `RecipientSection` consumers
  such as Unshield and all transaction confirmation screens are unaffected.
- `model/addressPoisoning.ts` owns the case-insensitive, eight-total-prefix/suffix
  heuristic, bounded response validation, and the loading/error/acknowledgement
  gate. No match is a heuristic result, never a guarantee of recipient safety.
  Tests: `tests/ui/addressPoisoning.test.ts` and `tests/history/sendRecipient.test.ts`.
  With `dev:preview` running, `qa:preview:send-safety` exercises the real Send
  component for all four signer props in both themes, keyboard acknowledgement,
  recipient changes, exact matches, unavailable reads and stale responses.
  Ledger renderer coverage does not replace real-device signing QA.

- `hooks/useTransferCatalog.ts` owns portfolio/catalog loading, selected-token
  balance and price fallbacks, custom-token lookup, and chain/token selection.
  It retains a 200-asset interaction projection, pins
  native/custom/recent/selected assets, and verifies only that bounded set.
- `hooks/useTransferRecipient.ts` owns recipient resolution, contract detection,
  and recipient search. Public contact name/avatar projection is delegated to
  shared `useAddressContactIdentities` so Send and Address Book stay identical.
  It also exposes the complete saved contact order and trusted mutation
  callbacks to the shared picker list; excluded wallet-address contacts retain
  their slots when the visible Send subset is reordered.
  Exact local contact or wallet addresses bypass reverse resolution and retain
  their known label/avatar synchronously; contract-recipient detection remains
  independent and still runs for the resolved raw address.
- `hooks/useTransferPreparation.ts` owns amount/calldata state and pure transfer
  preparation, including slider sound semantics and deployment preconditions.
- `hooks/useNativeMaxAmount.ts` reuses trusted-wallet gas estimation to reserve
  a chain-specific native fee before MAX/100%; `model/nativeMaxAmount.ts` owns
  the exact bigint subtraction and conservative fee-tier policy.
- `hooks/useSponsoredTransfer.ts` owns premium eligibility, durable ERC-3009
  recovery checks, intent IDs, acknowledgement, and sponsored submission.
- `model/sponsoredTransferPolicy.ts` owns the temporary Base-USDC sponsorship
  feature gate. It is currently disabled, so Base USDC uses normal ERC-20
  transaction intake for private-key, seed-phrase, and Bankr accounts.
- `hooks/useTransferSubmission.ts` owns the normal pending-transaction message
  and selects between Bankr-sponsored and normal confirmation intake. Signing
  remains in the background transaction domains for private-key, seed-phrase,
  and Bankr accounts; impersonators use the same review intake and can only
  submit through the selected RPC's explicit developer opt-in.
  Both ordinary submission and the sponsored-send fallback respect the Send
  recipient gate; signing and confirmation handlers retain their existing policy.

## Dependency direction

The compatibility facade points to the composition root. The root depends on
sections and hooks; sections depend only on shared UI primitives and pure
types/helpers. Hooks may depend on renderer-safe portfolio/RPC/message facades,
but never on sections. No file in this folder stores secrets or signs locally.

## Change rules

- Keep visual sections and effect-owning hooks separate; do not grow the root
  into a page-sized component or replace it with one all-purpose hook.
- Keep files below roughly 400 lines and split by a named user-facing or effect
  responsibility before they approach that limit.
- Preserve native/ERC-20 calldata construction, sponsored Base USDC recovery,
  normal `initiateTransfer` intake, recipient safety gates, and all wallet-type
  paths when moving code.
- Copy actions use inline Copy/Check feedback and every displayed address keeps
  its explorer action.

Pure amount/account-label behavior is covered by
`tests/ui/transferFormatting.test.ts`; durable sponsored recovery is covered by
`tests/sponsoredTransfers/sponsoredTransferReconciliation.test.ts`. Normal
private-key/seed-phrase/Bankr signing continues through the transaction suites
and `qa:extension:signing`.
