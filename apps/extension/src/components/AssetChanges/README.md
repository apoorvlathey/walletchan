# Asset Changes UI audit map

`../AssetChangesDisplay.tsx` is the compatibility facade used by transaction
and batch confirmation callers. It preserves the default display export and
the named simulation-warning banner exports.

## Responsibilities

- `AssetChangesDisplay.tsx` resolves the active chain explorer, composes the
  simulation hook and presentation, and owns the memoized public component.
- `useAssetChangesSimulation.ts` owns Chrome simulation messages, screen-entry
  deferral, parent status callbacks, the released three-attempt metadata retry
  schedule, and non-blocking late residual-approval detection keyed to the
  exact durable request identity.
  Optional preparation gating defers the initial RPC, and a scoped loading
  callback reports completion including transport failures. Safe combined
  signing waits for its outer execution preview before beginning simulation.
- `AssetChangesPanel.tsx` owns loading, empty, collapsed-summary, and grouped
  approval/Send/Receive presentation. Approval increases are rendered
  before asset deltas and remain visible when asset simulation is unavailable;
  verified residual allowances render in a separately divided region after
  the corresponding asset deltas.
- `ApprovalChangesGroup.tsx` renders verified and unverified ERC-20/Permit2
  allowance increases as centered token identities above aligned spending-limit
  and spender detail rows,
  reuses `TokenContractPopover` for token-symbol hover/focus address actions,
  promotes unlimited grants to danger styling, and discloses
  incomplete-detection state without nesting another warning card.
- `ResidualApprovalBanner.tsx` renders one compact token-led, unboxed warning
  without resolving or displaying spender names. Its per-token `Revoke?`
  action explains the appended batch call on hover/focus; two or more remaining
  rows add one centered `Revoke all` action. It owns only local
  request/loading/error/completed interaction state. The token symbol reuses
  the shared contract popover for address, copy, and explorer disclosure.
- `approvalCleanupAvailability.ts` is the pure all-wallet-type projection for
  whether a cleanup action is available and why it is disabled.
- `approvalCleanupTransport.ts` is the narrow trusted-renderer message adapter
  and opaque-evidence projector; request-family composition roots choose and
  invoke its single or atomic bulk mutation without returning token/spender
  authority to the renderer.
- `AssetRow.tsx` renders one asset delta, restores shared token-symbol contract
  disclosure, and keeps fungible-token copy/explorer actions in the shared symbol popover.
  Metadata-row actions remain only for assets without that disclosure.
- `TokenIcon.tsx` delegates fungible-token imagery and symbol fallback to the
  shared `TokenLogo`, keeping request and receipt identities synchronized.
- `NftMedia.tsx` owns NFT tags, bounded-raster `SafeImage` rendering, and the
  fullscreen preview. Raw SVG/data markup and metadata-controlled subresources
  must never enter this renderer.
- `SimulationBanners.tsx` owns the two parent-rendered simulation warnings.
- `assetChangesModel.ts` contains pure message selection, retry predicates,
  risk ordering, grouping, and approval-first collapsed-summary projection.
- `types.ts` contains feature-local component and batch-call contracts.

## Dependency and effect direction

`AssetChangesDisplay` → simulation hook / panel → rows and media. Simulation
messages stay in the hook; the explicit cleanup transport is the only adjacent
request-mutation boundary. `AssetRow` alone owns clipboard, timeout, and
explorer-window effects. Media depends on `SafeImage` and the sanitized avatar
cache; it never performs network requests. `TokenLogo` keeps its symbol fallback
visible while remote rasterization is pending. The pure models import only types.

## Coverage

- `tests/ui/assetChangesModel.test.ts` protects message selection, stable batch
  keys, approval metadata retry decisions, risk ordering, grouping, and
  approval-first summaries.
- `tests/ui/approvalCleanupAvailability.test.ts` freezes private-key,
  seed-phrase, Ledger, impersonator, Safe, and Bankr presentation policy.
- `tests/ui/residualApprovalPresentation.test.ts` freezes the compact copy,
  hover/focus explanation, and no-spender-label presentation contract.
- `tests/ui/tokenContractPopover.test.ts` requires both estimated and confirmed
  ERC-20 symbols to retain the shared hover/focus address, copy, and explorer
  disclosure with help-cursor and amber interaction feedback.
- `tests/network/remoteImageRendererBoundary.test.ts` protects the NFT and
  fungible-token `SafeImage` boundaries plus the shared token fallback.
- `tests/ui/architecture.test.ts` and `moduleSizeBudget.test.ts` protect the
  compatibility facade and implementation size.
