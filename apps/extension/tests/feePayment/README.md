# Fee-payment tests

- `tokens.test.ts` freezes the exact native/ERC-20 chain capability catalog and
  requires the extension and proxy address sets to remain synchronized.
- `capabilities.test.ts` covers private-key, seed-phrase, Ledger, view-only,
  and Bankr account gates, plus deployment, first-use, pre-delegated,
  foreign-delegate, and zero-balance option-filtering gates.
- `userOperation.test.ts` pins WalletChan's Stateless DeleGator call encoding and
  typed-data signature recovery.
- `authorization.test.ts` freezes real/dummy EIP-7702 authorization formatting.
- `paymaster.test.ts` and `prepareUserOperation.test.ts` cover bounded approval,
  quote math, provider ordering, allowance reads, and absolute per-token caps.
- `pimlicoClient.test.ts` rejects malformed, substituted, cross-request, and
  insecure provider responses, while mapping the known insufficient-remaining-
  selected-token paymaster failure to actionable user copy.
- `quoteStore.test.ts` and `quoteValidation.test.ts` freeze quote expiry,
  single-use request/account/call binding, and delegation/nonce races.
- `submission.test.ts` proves deterministic pre-broadcast hash persistence,
  definite rejection cleanup, and ambiguous-response recovery.
- `receiptValidation.test.ts` requires an independently fetched matching
  EntryPoint event before activity or ERC-5792 finality.
- `selectorLifecycle.test.ts` freezes bounded option/quote loading, explicit
  retry, the no-automatic-retry error state, shared single/batch/internal-Send
  presentation, and quote-bound Swap execution.
- `automaticFeeToken.test.ts` covers positive/zero/unknown balances, catalog
  ordering, locked reviews, and all direct signing account eligibility gates.

Background router tests separately freeze the trusted-UI audience and exact
fee-selection arguments for the three eligible signing-wallet paths; Ledger
remains explicit and native-only.

Run `node apps/extension/scripts/fee-payment-selection-qa.mjs` from the workspace
root for real React/Chrome lifecycle coverage of all five request families,
manual override, stale responses, request changes, and discovery timeouts.
It uses isolated mocked options and never signs or submits transactions.

Run `node apps/extension/scripts/fee-payment-refresh-qa.mjs` for real React/Chrome
fake-clock coverage of five automatic pre-expiry refreshes across all request
families, Retry allowance reset, quiet quote replacement, slow/failed/timed-out
refresh, disabled submission, request changes and cancellation. No live funds or
signing devices are used.
