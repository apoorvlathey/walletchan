# Ledger tests

These tests cover the hardware-wallet boundary without requiring a physical
device: derivation-path validation, trusted background routing, Chrome-only
offscreen exposure, exact service-worker authorization, public-only storage,
signing-policy wiring, commit-safe account selection, and deferred
pending-request terminalization across both transaction and message signing.
The no-device transaction lifecycle also freezes exact reviewed-nonce use,
including the nonce reservation boundary used by pending replacements.
Safe coverage additionally verifies that a real SafeTx EIP-712 payload passes
through the centralized Ledger signer and recovers to the pinned account, that
Safe owner/executor selection includes Ledger, and that native execution reuses
the central raw-transaction path while token gas remains blocked.

Maintainer-confirmed real-device QA was completed on 2026-07-23 for WebHID
discovery, Ethereum-app prompts, address scans, transaction signatures,
personal signatures, and EIP-712 signatures. Repeat this matrix when Ledger
transport/signing policy or supported device/app behavior changes.
Ledger-backed Safe owner approval and native-gas execution were added after
that run and still require their first real-device QA pass.

Force-inclusion tests cover real signature recovery through a mocked device,
master/agent sessions, lock/epoch/device/path/cancellation invalidation, OP Stack
and Robinhood parent-approval ordering, safe retries, uncertain sends and
post-send storage failure. These tests do not replace real-device QA.
