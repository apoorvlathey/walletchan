# WalletChan

Self-custodial Ethereum and EVM browser wallet + landing page website in a pnpm
workspace monorepo. The extension supports local private-key and seed-phrase
accounts, Ledger hardware accounts, existing Safe multisigs, view-only
accounts, and an optional Bankr API remote-signing account. Bankr is one
account integration, not WalletChan's product identity or universal execution
path.

**Chains**: WalletChan ships a broad built-in EVM registry and lets eligible
local, Ledger, and view-only accounts add custom EVM chains. Bankr accounts are
limited to entries marked `isBankrSupported`, and individual features have
their own eligibility. The single source of truth is
`apps/extension/src/constants/chainRegistry.ts`; see
[`_docs/ADD_CHAIN.md`](./_docs/ADD_CHAIN.md).

## Always-on guardrails (read these first)

These rules apply to almost every change. The detailed docs are listed in [Documentation References](#documentation-references) — read the one that matches the area you're touching.

### Test ALL four wallet types

Signing account types: `privateKey` (local), `seedPhrase` (local HD), `ledger`
(hardware), and `bankr` (optional API signing). WalletChan also supports
`impersonator` (view-only) accounts and `safe` contract accounts controlled by
linked signing owners.

- Features that touch transactions, signatures, or auth must be tested against **all four**. Different types use different code paths (e.g., `confirmTransactionAsync` vs `confirmTransactionAsyncPK`).
- Agent password must work for signing across ALL signing types, not just Bankr.
- Private-key reveal is blocked for the agent password regardless of wallet type.
- Execution features must reject impersonator accounts.

Common mistake: treating any one signer as the default path. Private-key,
seed-phrase, Ledger, and Bankr handlers differ; view-only accounts must stay
reject-only outside their explicit local-fork developer mode, and Safe actions
must remain proposals until their real approval/execution conditions are met.

### Tx-confirmation UI must stay consistent across surfaces

There are four confirmation surfaces (single, batch, cross-dapp batch, swap/bridge) — when one ships a new gas feature, the others must too. The swap path is the one most often missed. See [`_docs/TX_CONFIRMATION.md`](./_docs/TX_CONFIRMATION.md) for the surface table and required wiring (`isNonAtomic`, `onGasEstimates`, `onValidityChange`, applying overrides at sign time).

### Storage changes can brick existing users

Chrome auto-updates silently. Before adding/removing/renaming/reshaping ANY `chrome.storage` key, read [`_docs/STORAGE.md`](./_docs/STORAGE.md) (key reference + audit checklist) and [`_docs/PUBLISHING.md`](./_docs/PUBLISHING.md) (migration rules + pre-release checklist). Write an idempotent migration in the focused install/update lifecycle module if old users would break. Audit ALL read AND write paths through the owning router/composition/domain and renderer settings surfaces.

### Handlers that need credentials need session restoration

Any new message handler using `getCachedPassword()` / `getCachedApiKey()` must include the session restoration block (for "Never" auto-lock mode after service worker restart). Canonical pattern + handler list in [`_docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md`](./_docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md) → "Adding New Handlers".

### Pre-commit security check

Before any commit that touches extension code (message handlers, storage, crypto, content scripts, session management), verify against the checklist in [`_docs/SECURITY.md`](./_docs/SECURITY.md).

### Keep extension logic in auditable domains

Before adding service-worker logic, read
[`apps/extension/src/chrome/README.md`](./apps/extension/src/chrome/README.md)
and [`_docs/SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md`](./_docs/SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md).
The `src/chrome/` root is reserved for build entrypoints, policy-free stable
facades, and true cross-domain primitives. Related implementations belong in a
named subfolder with a README audit map and mirrored test folder. Do not create
another flat prefix family or grow a transitional coordinator to avoid making a
module.

## AI Session Workflow

At the **start of each session**, before writing code, read the doc that matches your area:

1. Extension logic / message passing / background handlers / crypto → [`_docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md`](./_docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md)
2. UI components / styling → [`_docs/STYLING.md`](./_docs/STYLING.md) (and [`_docs/THEME.md`](./_docs/THEME.md) if touching theme tokens)
3. Landing page → [`_docs/WEBSITE.md`](./_docs/WEBSITE.md)
4. Build/dev environment / commands / Firefox / Railway → [`_docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`](./_docs/DEVELOPMENT.md)

After making significant changes, **update the corresponding doc** if you modified message types, storage keys, handler logic, encryption, content-script filtering, or storage shapes. Future sessions depend on accurate docs.

## Monorepo Structure

Independent apps now live in separate repositories. See
[`_docs/REPOSITORIES.md`](./_docs/REPOSITORIES.md) for ownership and integrations.

```

The extension has six Vite build targets: main, onboarding, inpage, inject,
background, and the Chrome-only Ledger offscreen document. Dapp requests flow
through the injected provider and background policy before routing to the
selected local, Ledger, Bankr, or Safe path. Full details live in
[`_docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md`](./_docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md).

When validating or preparing the unpacked Chrome extension, always run
`pnpm build:extension` from the repo root. Do not use package-level partial
builds such as `pnpm --filter @walletchan/extension build:web` for extension
reload testing: they only refresh part of `apps/extension/build/` and can leave
manifest-referenced scripts like `static/js/inject.js`, `static/js/inpage.js`,
or `static/js/background.js` missing or stale.

The extension theme system is token-driven: Warm Midnight is the default and
Bauhaus remains an optional extension-only alternate. The website and docs site
use Warm Midnight. Components consume *intent* tokens (`accent.primary`,
`surface.raised`, etc.), never theme-color literals. See
[`DESIGN.md`](./DESIGN.md), [`_docs/WARM_MIDNIGHT.md`](./_docs/WARM_MIDNIGHT.md),
and [`_docs/THEME.md`](./_docs/THEME.md).

## Important Patterns (extension)

- **API key encryption**: AES-256-GCM with PBKDF2 (600k iterations). Vault-key system layered on top — see [`_docs/STORAGE.md`](./_docs/STORAGE.md).
- **Session caching**: decrypted creds cached in background-worker memory with auto-lock timeout.
- **Per-tab chain state**: each tab maintains its own selected chain.
- **Transaction persistence**: pending txs survive popup close (`chrome.storage.local`).
- **EIP-6963** modern wallet discovery alongside legacy `window.ethereum`.
- **Shared contract constants**: `packages/shared/src/contracts.ts` is the single source of truth (`BASE_CHAIN_ID`, `BNKRW_TOKEN_ADDRESS`, `SBNKRW_VAULT_ADDRESS`, `BNKRW_POOL_ADDRESS`). Import via `@walletchan/shared/contracts`.
- **Address display**: any `0x` shown in the UI must include a CopyIcon/CheckIcon copy button AND an explorer link (`${chainConfig.explorer}/address/${addr}`). Reference: `TypedDataDisplay.tsx` `AddressValue`.
- **Copy button feedback**: NEVER use toasts for copy (they block nearby Reject/Confirm buttons). Toggle `CopyIcon` → `CheckIcon` (`accent.highlight`) for 2s. Use the shared `CopyButton` component when possible.
- **Token-driven theming**: consume intent tokens (`accent.*`, `surface.*`, `fg.*`, `border.*`, `status.*`, `chart.*`) — never hex literals or `bauhaus.red`. See [`_docs/THEME.md`](./_docs/THEME.md).
- **Reject All button color**: use `chart.negative` (not `status.error.fg` — that's WHITE in Bauhaus and renders invisibly).
- **Dark CTA strip**: use `useStripTokens()` from `@/theme` for inverted bars (tx count badges, chat headers, "Add Token" CTAs). Don't inline `themeId === "midnight" ? ... : ...` ternaries.
- **External lookups go through a single cached helper** (e.g., `getEthShLabels`, `fetchTokenInfo`, `getCachedTokenLogo`) — never let multiple surfaces fire their own request for the same resource.
- **Chain meta resolution**: anywhere code needs a chain name / icon / explorer / native-asset metadata for an *arbitrary* chain ID (i.e., one that could be a user-added custom chain — bridge destinations, tx history, swap selectors, …), use `getResolvedChainById(chainId, networksInfo)` from `@/lib/chains` — **not** `getChainConfig(chainId)`. `getChainConfig` only knows the built-in registry and returns `"Unknown"` / empty icon for custom chains.
- **Native asset metadata**: when computing a native token's symbol / name / decimals / logo, use the centralized `getNativeAssetMeta(chainId, networksInfo)` from `@/lib/chains`. It resolves through `getResolvedChainById` (custom-chain-aware) and ensures the logo falls back to the chain icon for non-ETH natives (AVAX on Avalanche, BNB on BNB Chain, …). Never inline `symbol === "ETH" ? "/chainIcons/ethereum.svg" : getChainConfig(chainId)?.icon`.

## Writing Conventions

- **Use "onchain", not "on-chain".** Project-wide spelling — user-facing strings, comments, doc files, identifiers. Same for derived forms ("onchain balance", "confirmed onchain"). Don't reintroduce the hyphenated form.

## Code Quality Rules

- **Keep implementation files under ~400 lines.** Split before the limit; do
  not treat it as a target. Generated data and frozen fixtures are the routine
  exceptions.
- **Oversized composition roots are ratchets.** Existing transitional roots may
  remain over 400 only while being decomposed. Never raise their enforced size
  budget or add policy inline.
- **One concern per file.** E.g., `sessionCache.ts` owns credential caching; `authHandlers.ts` owns unlock/password.
- **`background.ts` is a bootstrap invocation only.** It imports and invokes
  `background/bootstrap.ts`. Lifecycle behavior, message order,
  authorization policy, storage work, and other business logic stay in
  `chrome/background/` or the owning domain, never inline in the entrypoint.
- **No new flat `src/chrome/` implementation families.** New logic goes in its
  owning domain folder. Root files are limited to entrypoints, documented
  policy-free compatibility facades, and genuinely shared primitives.
- **Every domain has an audit map.** Keep its `README.md` current with file
  responsibilities, dependency direction, storage/network effects, public
  facade, and matching `tests/<domain>/` coverage.
- **Facades re-export; they do not implement.** They must contain no
  authorization, cryptography, storage, networking, or business policy.
- **Mirror tests by domain and keep the test root empty.** Put frozen released
  records in `tests/fixtures/` and shared harnesses in `tests/helpers/`.
- **Treat `tests/security/chromeDomainLayout.test.ts` as an admission gate.**
  Never add a flat root implementation to its allowlist just to make the test
  pass; use an owning source/test domain with both README audit maps.
- **Moves preserve contracts.** Keep storage keys, serialized records, message
  names, exact public exports, and irreversible-effect ordering unchanged.
  Add facade-identity, forbidden-dependency, root-clutter, and size-budget tests
  with the move.
- **Dependencies point inward.** Router → coordinator → policy/repository/pure
  transform. Use dependency injection instead of circular imports.
- **Search before you build.** Before writing any new component, hook, utility, storage helper, or handler, grep the codebase. If something does ~80% of what you need, extend it (add an optional override callback) instead of forking it. Primitives that already exist: `CopyButton`, `useCachedAvatarSrc`, `useCachedAvatarMap`, `ERC20ApproveDisplay`, `TokenAmount`, `AddressValue`, `useThemedToast`, `useStripTokens`, `getEthShLabels`, `fetchTokenInfo`, `getCachedTokenLogo`.
- **Extract shared utilities** when the same logic appears in 2+ files (see `cryptoUtils.ts`).
- **Use dependency injection** to avoid circular imports (e.g., `tryRestoreSession(unlockFn)` takes a callback).
- **Naming**: `*Handlers.ts` for handlers; `*Storage.ts` / `*Cache.ts` for state; `*Utils.ts` for utilities. Functions sharing state belong in the same module.
- **New message handlers**: add a focused handler inside the owning domain,
  route it in exactly one `background/*Router.ts`, classify its audience in
  `messageAccessPolicy.ts`, and compose it through the ordered message pipeline.
  Do not add a residual switch to `background.ts`. Update
  [`_docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md`](./_docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md) and the domain audit map.

## Foundry libraries (separate contracts repository)

Always install via git submodules: `cd /path/to/contracts && forge install <org>/<repo>` — do NOT use `--no-git`.
